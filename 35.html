2025-04-21 | Vatican City -- Pope Francis has died of heart failure, age 88.[](https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-francis-dead-01ca7d73c3c48d25fd1504ba076e2e2a)
2025-04-22 | India, Pakistan --- A deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir (the disputed region that is nominally independent but effectively split between India and Pakistan) has triggered conflict between India and Pakistan. The attack took place in Pahalgam, a town in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, and killed 26 civilian tourists.[](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/attack-tourists-indian-kashmir-kills-26-people-injures-17-police-say-2025-04-23/)[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl/) The Indian Armed Forces blamed an Islamic terrorist group called [The Resistance Front (TRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_Front), one of several organizations like it dedicated to conquering Kashmir for Pakistan. In response, India launched missiles into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and later into Pakistan itself (2025-05-07), saying it was targetting terrorist organizations. Pakistan alleged they were targeting civilian areas, including mosques, and retaliated. Things escalated back and forth until both nation's militaries were striking each other, causing international concern and US involvement. A ceasefire was reported on 2025-05-10. The details of this conflict are more complex than I should try to summarize here. [See the conflict's page on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)
