# **Lex Fridman** | 2025-01-26

I was recently watching some interviews by a person named Lex Fridman (pronounced Friedman, but spelled wrong because he's Russian or something), specifically after [Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to interview with him](https://x.com/ZelenskyUa/status/1862934627796635752). The soaring popularity of Fridman's content was a mystery to me at a glance. He hasn't done anything especially noteworthy or been a part of any important organization. He's just some guy with a podcast. How did he end up sitting down with Zelensky, somebody at the centre of the most important world conflict, who hasn't done kind of this long-form media appearance before?

![Lex Fridman in a recent episode of his YouTube show](images/35-1.png)

It turns out this happened as part of [a broader media strategy by Zelensky and his advisers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/10/ukraine-zelensky-lex-fridman-podcasts/) to reach out to popular 'alternative' news sources that are popular among US Republicans (because that party just won everything). This is a delicate game, because the most popular right-wing media figures are Putin admirers who consume and help spread Russian propaganda (e.g. Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, Tim Pool). By comparison, Lex Fridman probably *seemed* less crazy and therefore more approachable---a good place to start if Zelensky wants to get his message out to these people. And you can bet he's going to be cordial and say nice things, even to Trump. The future of Ukraine depends on him setting certain things aside and being an effective diplomat.

If you were to read a transcript of any of these interviews---not just the Zelensky episode, but any of them---you wouldn't get the impression you're talking to somebody highly qualified, nor getting anything deeper than a segment on the evening news. Nor is Mr. Fridman an entertaining or unique personality. He doesn't offer the relaxed, casual appeal of unwinding with a simpletom like on the Joe Rogan Experience. Instead, you can expect simple questions asked in a rather dry manner, like a job interview, but one that's *trying* to be high brow. There's a lot of posturing---a lot of [telling.](17.html)

### **The deep, soft-spoken intellectual**

With enough perseverance, even a person who's just average at something can eventually build a reputation and audience. Just turn on your stream, or upload content, or publish articles, regularly, reliably, and over a long enough period of time, and the longevity of your career will itself become noteworthy. Is that part of Mr. Fridman's current popularity? It may be, as his career so far is a demonstration of, at least, a consistent work ethic. But I think far more important is how Fridman sells to his audience the *feeling* that they're listening to a *deep, soft-spoken intellectual*. It makes you feel smart for listening to it, even when nothing meaningful is really being said. This is the result of conscious choices about how Lex presents himself, from the way he speaks, his tidy hair and clothes, and the various phrases he's always weaving into everything.

That recent [episode of his podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc) featuring Zelensky contains many examples of the kind of audience virtue-signalling that I'm referring to. This is all from within a 10-minute window:

>"I see language as both a barrier for communication and a portal into understanding the spirit of a people connected by that language. It's all a weird and beautiful puzzle, and I'm just excited to get a chance to explore it." ...
>
>"It's really important for me to read books from various perspectives, and I'm always trying to calculate the bias under which the author operates and adjusting for that in my brain, as I integrate the information." ...
>
>"My job in this case and in all cases, is to adjust, based on my understanding of the author's biases and to take the wisdom from the text where it can be found, and putting the inaccuracies aside into the proverbial dustbins of history." ...
>
>"As I'm reading, I'm writing down my thoughts as they come up, always digging for some deeper insight about human nature." ...
>
>"I constantly am searching for simple but profound insights at various levels of abstraction. Sometimes this means asking a trivial question in hopes of uncovering the non-trivial, counter-intuitive but fundamental idea that opens the door to a whole new way of looking at the field. And actually, every guest is their own puzzle." ...
>
>"I always try to put my ego aside completely and do whatever it takes to have a good conversation and serve the listener. This means being open-minded, vulnerable, curious, and challenging the guest when needed."
>
> --- Lex A. Fridman, January 2025

This is just scratching the surface. Does any of it feel authentic to you? It must be appealing to some people, but to me it all just comes off like an actor playing a 'deep thinker' guy on television. And not in a well-written drama where you actually buy that the character's a genius. It's more like a side character in a sitcom that's supposed to be *making fun of* an up-their-own-ass college student trying to sound smart for a girl or something. I realized while writing this who Lex Fridman reminds me of: Ryan Howard from The Office. They even look similar, sort of? An unfortunate amount of what he says could be late-season Ryan lines.

What makes all it funny is how unspecific and hollow so much of it is. It's just the *aesthetics* of being intelligent, like a smart-person caricature. "Look at me, I read books. A lot of books. I integrate information while reading books into my mind. I go running along a river in the crisp autumn air, while recording my own deep thoughts about human nature. Life is like a puzzle. It's all a beautiful puzzle, and I'm just solving the puzzles with my books." None of this shit actually tells us anything meaningful about his process. What was the point of any of it? Selling himself, crafting his own image, telling the audience how they should think about him. It's like he's writing his own press releases, like when [Trump pretended to be John Barron.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_used_by_Donald_Trump#%22John_Barron%22_(1980s))

I tried to not jump to conclusions. I considered the possibility that Mr. Fridman *is* a genuinely intelligent, reflective person, but that he's accepted that he needs to virtue-signal and compliment himself like this, in order for people to appreciate all the work he does. I just found no reason to believe it because I don't see the results. Lex Fridman is somebody who tells but doesn't show. It all makes so much more sense if you suppose he's just an average-intelligence guy who's putting on a cringe-worthy act of pretending to be a smart person.

Interestingly, he's developed some foolproof excuses for how disappointing his work is compared with the way he presents himself:

>"I'm reading, I'm writing down my thoughts... eventually I get a gigantic pile of thoughts and notes that I look over to refresh my memory, but for the most part I just throw them out. ... I should mention that my memory for specific facts, names, dates, quotes, is terrible. What I remember well is high-level ideas." ...
>
>"I realize that sometimes forgetting all the details, and the words needed to express them, makes me sound simplistic and even unprepared. I'm not." ...
>
>"I do ask a lot of challenging questions, including follow-ups, but always with empathy. I don't need to be right. I don't need to signal my moral or intellectual superiority to anyone. I try to do the opposite, actually, because I want the guest to open up, and I trust the intelligence of the listener to see for themselves if the guest is full of shit or not, to detect the flaws and the strengths of how the guest thinks or who they are deep down." ...
>
>"A lot of times, when interviewers grill the guest, it doesn't reveal much, except give a dopamine hit to the echo chambers who hate the guest." ...
>
>"In the actual conversation, I constantly am searching for simple but profound insights. ... Sometimes this means asking a trivial question in hopes of uncovering the non-trivial ..."
>
> --- Lex A. Fridman, January 2025

So if he ever sounds out of his depth? He's actually not---he's read all the books. He just forgot all the facts and details about the topic afterwards and threw out his notes. The only thing he does remember are vague narrative impressions (er, "high-level ideas"). Which, coincidentally, is also what's accessible to people who just read a summary of one book and scrolled their twitter feed every so often.

And if he's interviewing a crazy person who's making insane claims, and he mostly just sits there letting them make their ridiculous statements to his audience unchallenged, that's just because he trusts you as the listener to figure it all out yourself. If you expect him to provide challenge or pushback against absurd statements or lies, that just means you want him to *grill* the guest, which means you're in an echo chamber.

What an unassailable combination of claims he's put together. It's an airtight set of excuses for producing boring, unchallenging, surface-level interviews with ideologically charged people and to take no responsibility for the results and for the role that you're playing in legitimizing them and what they have to say.

## **The Russia problem**

It's good that Zelensky agreed to this interview, as he probably came out looking favourably. However, I wasn't the only one who noticed how terrible many of these questions were, and how pro-Russia the overall tone of the conversation still ended up being.

To be sure, it was amiable *on paper*: in the intro, Fridman called Zelensky a remarkable man, recalled during the interview a time he called Zelensky a hero for staying in Kiev, and in his comments after the interview adding that Zelensky is thoughtful and kind-hearted person. However, the implicit narrative of the interview is that Zelensky needs to turn the other cheek and allow Russia to get away with what it's done. **The message is that Trump and Putin are ready to stop fighting, but Zelensky is not, ergo the war is his fault.** It's his fault the war is still going on because he chooses to resist negotiation with Putin---who, by the way, is a reasonable person who loves his country. What the fuck are the implications here? Zelensky is basically getting blamed for the fact his country got attacked and he chose to fight back.

Fridman repeatedly congratulates himself for advocating for 'peace'. He doesn't want peace, he wants a Ukrainian surrender. He wants a Russian victory. Fridman wants to set the precedent that Russia can annex territory from your country, then "make peace" with your land. It plays into the longstanding Russian strategy perfectly. Imagine a kidnapper stealing your baby and then asking to make peace, by which they mean stop fighting one another, but without giving back your baby, who is simply theirs now. And you know this isn't the first time they've done something like this. There is nothing virtuous about Lex's position.

It's disgraceful to treat the war like it's Ukraine's choice and it can simply end any time. It's technically true in the most offensively stupid way: any war could be ended at any point in time if either side chooses to surrender. If Lex Fridman could go back in time, would he ask all of Europe to simply surrender and accept being ruled by Germany, because he prefers peace to war, and innocent people will die if we stand up to Hitler? That is not an outlandish parody. There were many people in Allied countries in the WWII period position was precisely that, and I do believe Lex Fridman would've been one of them. People who are this naive should have no part in conversations about war.

So many of Fridman's questions play perfectly into Russian propaganda. In the section "Martial Law and Elections", Fridman implies Ukraine is against freedom because they implemented martial law. He implies that Ukraine is a corrupt country. He implies freedom is being suppressed for the war effort, ergo if you love freedom then Zelensky should end the war by surrendering.

A question that irked some people was when Fridman asked "what do you admire about Donald Trump, and why do you think he won so overwhelmingly?" This actually wasn't the worst of it, though---Zelensky probably wanted an opportunity to praise Trump while talking to Trump supporters, and Lex effectively gave it to him by asking this. It just comes off as an insane way of asking the question, instead of, say, "What do you think of Trump?" And cue the laugh track: Lex Fridman doesn't seem to be joking when he says Trump and Elon Musk care a lot about fighting corruption.

### **Language**

Volodymyr Zelensky doesn't speak English very well, and Lex Fridman doesn't speak Ukrainian, whereas they're both fluent in Russian. So if language was of no broader social importance, the logical choice might be for them to do the interview in Russian.

But language *is* of broader social importance. What language you speak, at what time, to what audience, has implications. Zelensky isn't just some Ukrainian dude. He represents a nation, and a nation under siege, one whose culture and identity is under attack and being denied and repressed by an enemy that wants to absorb it into their own. [Russification has been an important part of Russian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification#In_the_Russian_Federation_(1991%E2%80%93present)) and is part of how land-empires justify expansion: claiming that people in another country's territory are truly part of *your* people (culturally) and ergo the space they occupy should rightfully be part of your country instead of that one. In the case of Russia's war with Ukraine, the Russian lie was that people in eastern Ukraine all spoke Russian, thought of theirselves as Russian, and wanted to become part of Russia.

Near the beginning of the war, Zelensky broadcast numerous messages intended for the Russian speaking public. He spoke Russian. It's been done. This was intended for an English-speaking audience, and there's no shortage of translators.

^**Language note**: Volodymyr Zelensky's name in Ukrainian is **Володимир Зеленський**. This didn't have a well-established English transliteration until recently, so it's been spelled in numerous different ways. The Ukrainian government spelled it 'Zelenskyy' in their documents when he was elected president in 2019, so that spelling became the most common way of referring to him---but some English media, like the BBC, continues to spell it Zelensky. I choose to do the same, because there are no 'hard rules' of transliteration, and putting two Y's at the end of a word is very unusual in English, and doesn't correspond with the way his name is pronounced, nor how it's spelled in Ukrainian. I don't know who thought it made sense to put that second Y at the end, but I want to throw tomatoes at them.

from intro of his Zelensky episode
Lex:
    I say this as somebody who deeply understands the geopolitical complexity and history of the region.

Joe Rogan Experience #2260
2025-Jan-22

Lex
    This is the strength and perhaps the weakness of Volodymyr Zelensky, who I do think is a historical figure and a great leader, is that he, one, deeply emotionally feels the suffering of the people, and the loss that war creates, and he single handedly has to unite the nation, and carry the will of the people and the morale of a people, he has to lift the morale of a people, and that kind of man struggles to make peace, because he understands---he wants justice, not peace. And so, from a position of strength there, he wants to go further, re-capture all of the land that he sees belongs to Ukraine. So his very strength, a man that stayed in Kiev, that said fuck you, we're going to win this, that kind of man that lifted a whole nation, that united a whole nation, that man is also struggled to make peace.
    
    Every conversation is its own puzzle, so let me try to explain my approach for this one. As I've said, I read and listened to a lot of material since February 24, 2022. There would be many weeks over the past three years where I would spend every day, over eight hours a day, of focused reading and research.
    
    So again, my two goals were to bring out the best in President Zelensky as a leader and a human being, and to give him every opportunity possible to signal that he's ready to make peace and to lay out his vision for what that peace might look like. Like I said, step one through ten is prepare well. I did. But step eleven is the actual conversation. There, the specific psychological and personality quirks and qualities of the guest matter a lot. My job is to try to cut through the bullshit walls we put up as human beings and reveal directly or indirectly who the person truly is and how they think. With Zelensky, he is a deeply empathic and emotional human being, who personally feels the suffering of the people of Ukraine in this war. This is a strength, and perhaps alos a weakness. But it os an important part of the reason why I said many times that he is a truly historic figure. Very few leaders in recent history would be able to pull off what he did: to stay in Kiev, to unite the country , to convince the West to join the war effort to the degree they did. He is also a showman, to borrow the title of the biography I recommended. A man with many layers of humour and wit, but also ego and temper. Sometimes fully self-aware, and sometimes losing himself in the emotional rollercoaster of a painful memory or a turn of phrase that he can use as a springboard for a angry soliloquy. ... The interview could've easily been 5 minutes or 3 hours, so I had to quickly gain his trust enough to open up and stay for a long-form conversation, but push him enough to reveal the complexities of his thought process and his situation. This is where humour and camaraderie is essential, and I would return to it often, though it was very difficult given the stakes, the heaviness, the seriousness of the topic of the war. So in this case, the approach I followed for this conversation is constant nudges and questions about peace, often using almost childlike statements or questions. I generally like these kinds of questions. On the surface they may seem naive. They're not. They are often profound in their simplicity, like a lot of questions that children ask. Remember, it was a child who pointed out that the emperor was not wearing any clothes. I like the simplicity, the purity, the boldness of such questions, to cut through the bullshit, to the truth. And that truth is that hundreds of thousands of people died in this war, and are dying every day. And all the other problems, from corruption, to suspended elections, to censorship, cannot be solved until peace is made. I give the president every single chance to signal willingness to negotiate, knowing that both Trump and Putin will listen to this conversation. I don't think he took it, and instead chose to speak very crude words toward Vladimir Putin. This is fully understandable, but not directly productive to negotiation. To clarify, I have hosted many conversations that were intensely critical of Vladimir Putin, but this conversation is with a world leader, speaking about another world leader during a historic opportunity for peace.

    transcript of a section of that Lex Fridman video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u321m25rKXc):

    I think translation is an art. And so getting a good translator that works well with us is a process that needs more time and effort. I'll be doing that more this month. By the way, we have a small but amazing team. If you want to join us, go to LexFridman.com/hiring. If you're passionate, work hard, and everyone on the team loves working with you, then we'll do some epic stuff together. We'd love to work with you. Like I said about Eleven Labs, there are a few things in awesome in life as being able to work hard with an amazing team towards a mission all of us are passionate about.
    
    Anyway, I'll probably be doing a few more interviews in the Russian language. I do have a lingering goal of interviewing the mathematician Grigori Perelman, but there's also others. I will also work on improving my whole pipeline, both equipment-wise and interpreter-wise, in doing these conversations in other languages, because there are many that I would like to do in languages I don't speak at all, like Chinese Mandarin, or Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Portugese, French, German. I see language as both a barrier for communication and a portal into understanding the spirit of a people connected by that language. It's all a weird and beautiful puzzle, and I'm just excited to get a chance to explore it.
    
    All right. I got a question on how I prepare for podcasts. So this has evolved and expanded more and more over time. There are some podcasts that I prepare hundreds of hours for. In AI terms, first I'm training a solid background model by consuming as much variety on the topic as possible. A lot of this comes down to picking high-signal sources, whether it's blogs, books, podcasts, YouTube videos, X accounts, and so on. For this conversation with president Zelensky, for example, since February 2022, I've spoken with hundreds of people on the ground, I've read Kindle or audiobook about 10 books fully, and then I skimmed about 20 more. And I don't mean books about Zelensky, although he does appear in some of them. I mean books where this conversation was fully in the back of my mind as I'm reading the books.

    So for example, I read Red Famine by Anne Applebaum. It's about Holodomor. Does it directly relate to Zelensky? Not on the surface, no, but it sort of continues to weave the fabric of my understanding of a people, of the history of the region. But it's really important for me to read books from various perspectives, and I'm always trying to calculate the bias under which the author operates and adjusting for that in my brain, as I integrate the information. For example, Anne Applebaum's book "Gulag" is very different from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago". The former is a rigorous comprehensive historical account, the latter is a literary psychological and personal portrait of Soviet society. Both, I think, are extremely valuable. On the bias from, for example, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" by William Shirer is a good example. It is full of bias, but he was there, and to me he has written probably one of the greatest if not the greatest book on the Third Reich ever. But like I said, it has a lot of inaccuracies and biases, you can read about them online if you like. But my job in this case and in all cases is to adjust, based on my understanding of the author's biases and to take the wisdom from the text where it can be found and putting the inaccuracies aside into the proverbial dustbins of history.

    So as I'm reading, I'm writing down my thoughts as they come up, always digging for some deeper insight about human nature. If I'm at my computer, I'll write it down in Google doc, sometimes use Notion or Obsidian, if I'm not at my computer I'll use Google keep. So for example if I'm listening to an audiobook and I'm running along the river, if a good idea comes to mind, I'll stop, think for a few seconds, and then do speech-to-text note in Google keep. By the way, listening to audio book at 1x speed. Old school. And eventually I get a gigantic pile of thoughts and notes that I look over to refresh my memory, but for the most part I just throw 'em out. It's a background model, building process. By the way, LLMs are increasingly becoming useful here for organization purposes, but have not yet been useful at least for me, and I do try a lot, for insight extraction or insight generation purposes. I should mention that my memory for specific facts, names, dates, quotes, is terrible. What I remember well is high-level ideas. That's just how my brain works, for better or for worse. I realize that sometimes forgetting all the details, and the words needed to express them, makes me sound simplistic and even unprepared. I'm not. But that's life. We have to accept our flaws and roll with them.

    Aside from books, I also listen to a lot of podcasts and YouTube videos where people are talking about the topic. So for the president Zelensky episode, I listened to probably hundreds of hours of content from his supporters and from his critics, from all sides. Again, I choose who to listen to based not on their perspective, but based on SNR, signal-to-noise ratio. If I'm regularly getting insights from a person, I will continue listening to them, whether I agree or disagree.

    In the end, this turns out to be a lot of hours of prep, but to say that it's X hours per episode is not accurate, because a lot of this preparation transfers from one guest to another, even when there's an insane level of variety in the guests. We're all humans, after all. There is a thread that connects all of it together, somehow, if you look closely enough.

    For more technical guests, in STEM fields, I'll read papers, a lot of papers, and also technical blog posts and technical tweet threads. This is a very different process. For AI or CS related topics, I will run other people's code. I will write my own, implement stuff from scratch. If it's a software company, I'll use their tools and software if relevant. But in the actual conversation, I constantly am searching for simple but profound insights at various levels of abstraction. Sometimes this means asking a trivial question in hopes of uncovering the non-trivial, counter-intuitive but fundamental idea that opens the door to a whole new way of looking at the field.

    And actually, every guest is their own puzzle. Like preparing for Rick Rubin was me listening to hundreds of songs he produced and even learning some on guitar, like Hurt by Johnny Cash. Preparing for the Cursor team episode meant obviously I had to use Cursor fully for several weeks, all of its features, so I switched completely from VS Code to Cursor. For Paul Rosolie, round 2 especially, I literally went deep into the jungle with Paul and almost died, fully taking the leap toward adventure with him.

    When it gets close to the conversation, I'll start working on the actual interview questions and notes. And there I'm asking myself, what am I personally curious about? Like I love podcasts, I'm a big fan of many, many podcasts, so I ask myself, what would I want this person to explain on a podcast? And maybe, what aspect of their thought process or humanity would to be surfaced, or have the chance to be surfaced?

    In the actual conversation, I always try to put my ego aside completely and do whatever it takes to have a good conversation and serve the listener. This means asking questions simply, trying to define terms and give context if needed, being open minded, vulnerable, curious, and challenging the guest when needed. Despite the claims on the internet, I do ask a lot of challenging questions, including follow-ups, but always with empathy. I don't need to be right. I don't need to signal my moral or intellectual superiority to anyone. I try to do the opposite, actually, because I want the guest to open up, and I trust the intelligence of the listener to see for themselves if the guest is full of shit or not, to detect the flaws and the strengths of how the guest thinks or who they are deep down.

    A lot of times, when interviewers grill the guest, it doesn't reveal much, except give a dopamine hit to the echo chambers who hate the guest. As I said in the intro, I believe the line between good and evil does run through the heart of every man. The resulting conversation is sometimes a failure. Sometimes because they're too short, sometimes because the chemistry is just not working, sometimes because I fucked it up.

    I try to take risks, give it everything I got, and enjoy the rollercoaster of it all, no matter what. And as I said, I trust the listener to put it all together, and I trust the critic to tear it apart, and I love you all for it.
