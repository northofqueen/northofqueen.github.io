# **Milo Yiannopoulos's cancellation**

Why did Milo Yiannopoulos get career-nuked? I heard a few people talking about it recently, and all of them somehow remembered incorrectly in a way that was more charitable toward him than is necessary. They forgot how bad it was. They implied that maybe people were just being too touchy.

There was an interview where Milo said when he was younger he had relations with men who were significantly older than him. Would it be strange to get cancelled for talking about your own experiences? Maybe, maybe not, but that's not really the thing that did him in.

In 2016, Milo went on [a 2-hour 47-minute YouTube panel talkshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azC1nm85btY) where he said that it's appropriate for 28-year-old men to have a relationship with a 13-year-old.

|transcript
[other host] | If someone I knew someone around my age that was like, I just had sex with a 13-year old, I would be creeped out.
**Milo** | But what is your age?
[other host] | I'm almost 35.
**Milo** | Okay, well I'm talking about 28 year-olds. I'm guessing, because I've never told this publicly, that you won't hear that in this video [referring to a different video they were watching on stream], **but we're talking about 13--25, 13--28. These things do happen, perfectly consensually.**
**Milo** | Often, by the way, it's the women who suffer in these. What normally happens in schools, very often, is it's an older woman with a younger boy, and the boy is the predator in that situation, the boy is like, let's see if I can fuck the gym teacher, or let's see if I can fuck the hot maths teacher, and he does.
**Milo** | The women fall in love with these nubile young men, or these athletic young boys in their prime, and end up having their lives destroyed, they end up having to move schools, move the country, whatever.
**Milo** | I would say, in the situation I describe in the Joe Rogan show, I was very definitely the predator on both occasions. As offensive as some people will find that, I don't much care. That was certainly my experience of it. I was very much the predator in that situation.

Take notice: Milo takes the opportunity to shift our focus from relationships where it's an older man and a little girl, to instead ones where both people are male, to instead where the older person is a woman---while still clearly maintaining that it's acceptable, no matter the gender of either person. He never disavows that example or says "this is only okay if it's an older woman". He clearly thinks it applies to young girls as well. And why wouldn't it? Young girls mature faster, don't they? He's trying to smuggle that view into what people are comfortable with by serving them less-bad examples first.

**Why did Milo say this?** Did he think he was untouchable? Did he not see the negative reaction coming? I think he was already *so* offensive to the left that he figured what they think doesn't matter, and the right was accepting him despite how offensive he was, so he lost track of the fact it was possible to piss them off too.
