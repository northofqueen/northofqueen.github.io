# **Reflections on Justin Trudeau** |2024-01-18

![](images/31-1.png)

The Liberal Party, the oldest political party in Canada, was at a low point in 2011. It was the first time in our history the Liberals were neither the governing party nor the opposition, instead falling down to third place in Parliament. They came roaring back in 2015 under **Justin Trudeau**'s leadership, seating a Liberal majority in Parliament with Trudeau as Prime Minister. In January 2025, he announced his intent to resign from his position both as Liberal Party leader and as Prime Minister, and to retire from politics in general. When that happens later this year, Trudeau will have been PM for 9 years.

In the end, with all said and considered, I wave farewell to Mr. Trudeau still thinking of him positively. There are criticisms one could make and there are some actions his supporters wish he'd taken that he did not, but on the whole Trudeau was an honest, well-meaning man who represented Canada well---even though by the end, the right was intent on blaming him for seemingly every problem in the country. He was a good reflection of us, of our average, of our feelings and values. It was very fitting that he should be who comes to mind when people around the world thought of Canada. There was nothing about him that was divisive, hateful, or stupid. He was well-educated, well-spoken, and wanted what was best for all of us, and for the world.

I was occasionally embarrassed by him, but never ashamed of him. His goofiness or misspeaks were fundamentally benign compared with the shame I'd have felt being British or American in many recent years. Indeed, I was very thankful to have Trudeau in office throughout the Russia--Ukraine war, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, throughout the 45th US presidency, throughout Brexit, and everything in between. There has been so much insanity on the world stage lately, and consistently Trudeau has been one of the faces of sanity.

### **Why is he stepping down?**

It's probably a simple political reality that you can't just be the incumbent for 10 years straight unless things are going very well and everybody is happy with the state of the country. And in Canada, that's not the case.

As such, I began to expect a couple years ago that Trudeau wouldn't be able to stick around longer than 2025 (the year by which we must have our next general election), as support for the Conservative opposition was predictably rising. A conflict within the Liberal Party itself has been the last cue to leave, but if it weren't this, it probably would've been something else.

I worry now for our future. I feel as though a storm is coming and our captain has just stepped down. I don't know who's going to step up and fill his place, but there is no alternative I feel good about. The Conservative Party leader, Poilievre, is another populist demagogue, one who's recently given up at not being a caricature of is claiming that he'll be 'Canada First'. Short clips of him are being pushed all over social media. I don't trust this man, and I fear what his relationship with the American president will be like.

The global trend recently (in the last decade or so) has been that those who have most loudly claimed to be patriotic nationalists all turn out to be some of the most despicable traitors. I hope he surprises me.
