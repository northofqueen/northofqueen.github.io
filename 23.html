# The tragedy of passing

^*The cameras aren't rolling yet, are they? Okay. How do I look?*<br>*Am I sitting properly? I don't want to sit like a man.*

Hi, my name's Emily---I mean, uh, no, wait, don't call me that around my family. The name my parents gave me was Connor. Ugh. I'm a trans woman, but like, in the closet. I don't know. I don't want everyone I know to disown me. Maybe I'm not really trans, anyway. I don't know.
 
My life is one of denial. I want to do girly stuff, sort of, I mean, as an experiment, but I also don't want people to think I'm too gay, you know? So I talk with a pretty low voice, and I, like, try to do manly things. I drink a beer sometimes. I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea. In fact, I want to do things that make them thing "nah, Connor's straight, I mean come on, look at him." That'll keep them away. Last year, I shaved my head. That's not something a trans person would do, right?

*When you're closeted and trying to not have people be suspicious of you, because you're afraid of negative perceptions from people in your life, the result is you're always self-aware, checking yourself, never fully relaxed around others. It's an inauthentic life, forcing yourself to be more masculine than you might really feel.*

Now it's a few years later. No, it's cool, you can call me Emily now. They all know.
 
I wear women's clothes in public now. I never drink beer, because that's, like, manly. I don't want to do things that people might perceive as masculine. That would be bad, right? I also need to dress really femininely every day. If I just wear pants and a shirt, people might think I'm a guy. And if I don't act femininely enough, some people will be like, why did you even transition? You don't seem like a woman to me. I have to act the part, to justify all this fuss!
 
I was at a friend's house last week, and they were playing a video game that I used to be good at. But I acted like I didn't know the game that well and lost, because I feel like girls aren't supposed to be good at those games. If I won, they'd probably be, like, "oh, look, a girl is good at a video game"---but really, what they'd be thinking is, "cis women aren't good at video games, but you're good because you're trans". That's not a conversation I want to have, you know?
 
I also need to be really careful about how I sit, how I do my hair, all that stuff. I need to show everyone that I'm committed. That means maybe leaning less into my masculine-coded hobbies.
 
I was recently watching videos on YouTube of how girls wave. I'm worried that I might not wave properly. Like, I wave like a dude. I think girls wave by keeping their elbow closer to their torso, while guys move their elbow far away from their torso. I try to keep that in mind, but I keep messing up and waving wrong. Oh god, I hope nobody notices.

*When you aren't closeted anymore but trying to pass, you end up still not being authentic, but now it's the other way around. You feel the need to exaggerate every aspect of yourself to try and fit the gender you identify with as best as you can. And the result is you might force yourself to be more feminine than you really feel.*

At what point can Emily just relax and do what she wants?
