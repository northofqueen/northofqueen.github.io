# **Therapy theory** |2025-01-09

This is my therapy theory, meaning my sort of model or framing or understanding of what therapy *is*.

**Therapy consists of 3 main things:**

1. give you someone to talk to so you feel heard
- identify your problem
- figure out the cause of your problem
- decide what to do about your problem

**For that final step, all roads lead to one of two outcomes:**

1. solving it isn't realistic, so instead focus on forgiving and accepting yourself
- solving it is realistic, so just try it til you get used to it (exposure therapy)

For example, let's say I'm unhappy. **Do I have anyone to talk to about it?** Some people do, but some people don't. Maybe your friends aren't receptive, or maybe you just don't feel comfortable talking to them about your feelings because they'll call you a gay sissy crybaby for having problems you can't instantly solve by walking them off (damn bro, your friends suck). Maybe you're a big loser who has no friends and talking to your cat just ain't it. The point is, sometimes people just need an ear, they need someone to sit down and listen to them. If you don't have anyone to talk with, that's something therapy can solve.

Then it's like, okay, why are you unhappy? A therapist asks you some broad questions, just exploring you a bit, seeing what's up. And you're like well, uh. I'm often pissed off while I'm at work. Maybe that's it---that's all I know, really. I'm pissed off at work. It's not much, but that's my starting point. Okay. Now what? A therapist is, among other things, a person who will help you figure out *why* you're pissed off at work, or whatever it is you're doing. Is it because you're annoyed at all your coworkers? Do you just lack patience? Is it because of your boss? Maybe it's because you feel inferior because you didn't achieve enough and you're not satisfied with where you are in your career. Oh yeah, shit, that resonates with me. Yeah. Huh. I never thought about it like that. Oh god, I think that's it. That's the first step: making your description of the problem more specific, since most people start in really broad terms.

Then it's like: why is that what you're feeling? And are you *actually* not far enough into your career, or whatever it was that's bothering you? Is this just an irrational feeling you're having that's not true if you try thinking it over rationally? If it's not, then let's talk about cognitive distortions, which are just descriptions of certain ways that you might be thinking about stuff wrong. Here's a list of like 15 of them. Maybe you're catastrophizing. Maybe you're *mind reading*. Maybe you're *filtering*. Maybe you're... yeah, you get it, doing one of those things. Go look that shit up if you want the full list, okay? And oh, by the way, do you want any medication? Because a therapist might also be able to hook you up with stuff that helps certain physical symptoms related to mental health stuff. And they might not. It depends on the person. That shit can help, though.

Now, regardless of how much you cared for that cognitive distortion talk, if you really want to get to the bottom of things: **where does that feeling you're having come from?** Why do you feel so inadequate about how far along you are in your career? Yeah, let's just keep going with that example. Is it because you struggled with school and got bullied for having bad grades? Is it because your father wasn't very successful and you're scared of being like him? I don't know---but everybody expects problems to have some kind of origin story. So they want to identify that, and most people find figuring out the origin of their problems to be satisfying and helpful to feeling like they can get over things, because you're "solving the puzzle" of your own mind.

Then finally, you have to figure out **what to do about this problem**. In some cases, the answer is you're never going to find a "fix" and you just have to live with it. So you might feel like you're kind og fucked, but that's okay, because so are lots of people. That's normal. I suck at certain things too. Don't be so hard on yourself, y'know? You're still a cool person who other people can value and love, even if you have certain things that you struggle with. But sometimes we hold ourselves to a high standard, even higher than we hold other people to. Think about other people in your life who you like. Don't they also suck at certain things? Don't they also fuck things up sometimes? Yeah. But you're still okay with them, right? Let's focus on being willing to forgive yourself for things that went wrong in your life, and focus on the good that you can do.

But maybe it *is* something you can fix and get over. Not all problems are unfixable. So how do you do that? What's the cure? It's not going to be like a doctor where they give you a pill or ointment. This side of the aisle is more talk-y. And there are a lot of different answers, depending on where you ended up, but on some level they're all variations of the same thing: you just have to do the stuff you don't want to do. That's it, that's the final boss of therapy. Maybe you do it once in a blue moon, maybe you do it an inch at a time, maybe you just bite the bullet and start at full-speed and hope it gets better. Whatever your specific approach ends up being, though, the only way things get better is if you figure out how to stop avoiding that thing you're avoiding. You know the thing.

Let's say you're stressed out because you're scared of heights. Here's a ladder, climb up a step. Then try climbing up two steps. Then three. And so on. Then go up a story and look out the window. Then two. And so on. That's the only real way you'll ever get over a fear of heights, is by conquering it by doing. That's also how you get over having severe social anxiety: you're going to have to interact with people. Really, for almost every mental health issues, there's an easily identifiable *thing* that you're avoiding, and you can either make peace with that by building your life around never having to do that thing (maybe you can go the rest of your life without ever going up a tall building? that's probably possible), or you can get over it by doing the thing. That's it.

So, there you go. That's therapy.

If you already have people to talk to in your life, so you don't feel that pressing need to *get it all out*---because seriously, talking about stuff makes everything feel better---and you already basically get what you're struggling with, why, and what to do about it, then you probably don't really need to go to therapy, quite frankly. You might benefit from it still, I guess. Like, you could. Maybe your therapist has some great insight that you never thought of. But it's also possible that you're just going to go through the motions explaining your situation to them so, at the end, they can tell you feel bad because of that stuff your parents did, and if you want to get better, you have to go do that thing you're avoiding. If you can figure out the stuff and the thing on your own, you might save yourself the hassle---and the money, if you're not somewhere you can get it all paid for.

No disrespect to therapists. This is just the result of my experiences with it.
