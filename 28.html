# Therapy | 2025-04-23

I think of mental health problems as a bundle, pattern, or profile of tendencies, difficulties, or symptoms. I also, rather than saying mentally ill or mental disorder, prefer to say mental health concerns, issues, conditions, or problems; or I use mental health as a noun instead of an adjective (as in "poor mental health"). I do this because mental health is often used as a way of insulting or demeaning people, which is why people feel nervous or defensive about discussing it at first. Your choice of language can help make your intentions, attitude, or view of things more clear, and help people feel more comfortable and less attacked.

There are many patterns of tendencies we're all aware of or hear about, and I think almost everybody either experiences at least one of them or knows at least one person who does. I'm not an expert, but this is my basic understanding of some of the most common ones:

- **ADHD** (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder---formerly hyperkinetic disorder)
 What's your heart rate? It goes up and down, but you also have a 'resting' heart rate, like the default that it stays at when you're just chilling and doing normal stuff, neither sleeping or meditating nor sprinting and working out. Similarly, we also have a baseline level of *stimulation*---as in, coffee versus alcohol, watching paint dry versus getting really into Tetris.
 The problem that people with ADHD experience is their 'resting' stimulation level is too low, meaning they're often bored or unengaged---but conversely, they're also very drawn to sources of stimulation. This is why they might seem to more difficult focusing on certain things that aren't particularly stimulating, like doing their schoolwork, but also why they can be easily distracted or conversely get pulled into hyperfixations---because when they find something that *is* stimulating, it's such a relief for them, because they're normally more starved for stimulation than the rest of us are. Imagine drinking water normally, and then drinking water when you're dehydrated and dying of thirst. It's like *oh my god, yes, finally*.
- **ASD** (autism spectrum disorder)
 I can buy a printer or camera or something and take it home and just plug it into my computer and it automatically works. This is because the way a computer utilizes a piece of hardware is by using a little set of code called a driver. In some cases you have to install drivers, but sometimes you don't have to because your computer just comes with various general-purpose drivers pre-installed. Humans are also like this: you don't need to learn how to breathe and make your heart beat, because that just works on its own. But we also install new drivers automatically as you grow from a child to an adult.
 A set of skills that seem to develop automatically---probably not if we locked you in a padded room for 18 years, but I mean without anyone having to explicitly 'teach' you these things, you sort of just teach yourself through experience---is being able to interpret and understand other humans. We can sit down with another person, look at each other, talk to each other, and you have a model in your head of how this person would interpret what's happening, of how they'll interpret your words, of what they'll think about the way you're acting, of your body language, and so on. And you can interpret their behaviour and derive from that how they might be thinking or feeling. Your have an awareness of their mind, to put in briefly.
 This is what people with ASD lack. They don't develop the same innate, automatic understanding of this sort of thing. They have difficulty perceiving things through other people's perspective. As a result, they might struggle with socializing, making friends, and reading social cues. If you have ASD, it's possible for you to learn these things---it just takes effort, because it doesn't come to you as automatically as it does to others. Autistic people typically prefer it when things are explicitly clarified, and dislike ambiguous or implied expectations.
 <small>The name 'autism' originally came from *autos*, meaning self, the same Greek route as in words like automobile or autobiography. This is because the researcher who observed it related it to children who seemed especially self-absorbed and uninterested in socialization or play with others, instead doing tasks alone (leading to later stereotypes about autistic children repetitively stacking blocks and other like things).</small>
- **OCD** (obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder)
- anxiety
- depression

## Therapy

This is my therapy theory, meaning my model or framing or understanding of what therapy *is*.

Therapy **gives you someone to talk to**, so you feel heard and you have somebody to undergo this process with, because it can be tricky to do alone. Then, with that person, you pursue three things:

1. identify your problem
- figure out the cause of your problem
- decide what to do about your problem

**For that final step, all roads lead to one of two outcomes:**

1. solving it isn't realistic, so instead focus on forgiving and accepting yourself
- solving it is realistic, so just try it til you get used to it (exposure therapy)

For example, let's say I'm unhappy. **Do I have anyone to talk to about it?** Some people do, but some people don't. Maybe your friends aren't receptive, or maybe you just don't feel comfortable talking to them about your feelings because they'll call you a gay sissy crybaby for having problems you can't instantly solve by walking them off (damn bro, your friends suck). Maybe you're a big loser who has no friends and talking to your cat just ain't it. The point is, sometimes people just need an ear, they need someone to sit down and listen to them. If you don't have anyone to talk with, that's something therapy can solve.

Then it's like, okay, why are you unhappy? A therapist asks you some broad questions, just exploring you a bit, seeing what's up. And you're like well, uh. I'm often pissed off while I'm at work. Maybe that's it---that's all I know, really. I'm pissed off at work. It's not much, but that's my starting point. Okay. Now what? A therapist is, among other things, a person who will help you figure out *why* you're pissed off at work, or whatever it is you're doing. Is it because you're annoyed at all your coworkers? Do you just lack patience? Is it because of your boss? Maybe it's because you feel inferior because you didn't achieve enough and you're not satisfied with where you are in your career. Oh yeah, shit, that resonates with me. Yeah. Huh. I never thought about it like that. Oh god, I think that's it. That's the first step: making your description of the problem more specific, since most people start in really broad terms.

Then it's like: why is that what you're feeling? And are you *actually* not far enough into your career, or whatever it was that's bothering you? Is this just an irrational feeling you're having that's not true if you try thinking it over rationally? If it's not, then let's talk about cognitive distortions, which are just descriptions of certain ways that you might be thinking about stuff wrong. Here's a list of like 15 of them. Maybe you're catastrophizing. Maybe you're *mind reading*. Maybe you're *filtering*. Maybe you're... yeah, you get it, doing one of those things. Go look that shit up if you want the full list, okay? And oh, by the way, do you want any medication? Because a therapist might also be able to hook you up with stuff that helps certain physical symptoms related to mental health stuff. And they might not. It depends on the person. That shit can help, though.

Now, regardless of how much you cared for that cognitive distortion talk, if you really want to get to the bottom of things: **where does that feeling you're having come from?** Why do you feel so inadequate about how far along you are in your career? Yeah, let's just keep going with that example. Is it because you struggled with school and got bullied for having bad grades? Is it because your father wasn't very successful and you're scared of being like him? I don't know---but everybody expects problems to have some kind of origin story. So they want to identify that, and most people find figuring out the origin of their problems to be satisfying and helpful to feeling like they can get over things, because you're "solving the puzzle" of your own mind.

Then finally, you have to figure out **what to do about this problem**. In some cases, the answer is you're never going to find a "fix" and you just have to live with it. So you might feel like you're kind of fucked, but that's okay, because so are lots of people. That's normal. I suck at certain things too. Don't be so hard on yourself, y'know? You're still a cool person who other people can value and love, even if you have certain things that you struggle with. But sometimes we hold ourselves to a high standard, even higher than we hold other people to. Think about other people in your life who you like. Don't they also suck at certain things? Don't they also fuck things up sometimes? Yeah. But you're still okay with them, right? Let's focus on being willing to forgive yourself for things that went wrong in your life, and focus on the good that you can do.

But maybe it *is* something you can fix and get over. Not all problems are unfixable. So how do you do that? What's the cure? It's not going to be like a doctor where they give you a pill or ointment. This side of the aisle is more talk-y. And there's a lot of different answers, depending on where you ended up, but on some level they're all variations of the same thing: you just have to do the stuff you don't want to do. That's it, that's the final boss of therapy. Maybe you do it once in a blue moon, maybe you do it an inch at a time, maybe you just bite the bullet and start at full-speed and hope it gets better. Whatever your specific approach ends up being, though, the only way things get better is if you figure out how to stop avoiding that thing you're avoiding. You know the thing.

Let's say you're stressed out because you're scared of heights. Here's a ladder, climb up a step. Then try climbing up two steps. Then three. And so on. Then go up a story and look out the window. Then two. And so on. That's the only real way you'll ever get over a fear of heights, is by conquering it by doing. That's also how you get over having severe social anxiety: you're going to have to interact with people. Really, for almost every mental health issues, there's an easily identifiable *thing* that you're avoiding, and you can either make peace with that by building your life around never having to do that thing (maybe you can go the rest of your life without ever going up a tall building? that's probably possible), or you can get over it by doing the thing. That's it.

So, there you go. That's therapy.

If you already have people to talk to in your life, so you don't feel that pressing need to *get it all out*---because seriously, talking about stuff makes everything feel better---and you already basically get what you're struggling with, why, and what to do about it, then you probably don't really need to go to therapy, quite frankly. You might benefit from it still, I guess. Like, you could. Maybe your therapist has some great insight that you never thought of. But it's also possible that you're just going to go through the motions explaining your situation to them so, at the end, they can tell you feel bad because of that stuff your parents did, and if you want to get better, you have to go do that thing you're avoiding. If you can figure out the stuff and the thing on your own, you might save yourself the hassle---and the money, if you're not somewhere you can get it all paid for.

No disrespect to therapists. This is just the result of my experiences with it.
