# **Why get bottom surgery?** |2025-02-06

In the past, if you wanted legal recognition as a trans woman, you had to get a vaginoplasty. No dicks in the lady's room. That was the rule. I think in some places another option was if you had an orchiectomy or some other form of castration instead. No balls in the lady's room. How nice of them. These days, getting surgery is less required and treated more like a personal choice. And it's a really difficult personal choice. There are some reasons to want to avoid it, which are more obvious than the reasons for it. It's scary. Surgery is scary. What if something goes wrong? They're cutting you open. It hurts. You take weeks or months recovering. It's anxiety-inducing because it's a big step, and there's no going back. And there are horror stories out there, if you look for them, of what a bad spot you could end up stuck in if things don't turn out well.

Less obvious are the reasons why trans women desire these procedures despite the fear and anxiety. For many people, the assumption is that trans women simply hate their penises, because gender dysphoria. We look down at them, think "oh no", and then want them gone. That's often part of it. Women aren't supposed to have penises, our subconscious minds tell us. That's not normal. So when we look at ourselves, and we see something very different from what other women have, it can make us feel wrong, broken, like there's something about us that isn't right. I've many times heard about trans women who *don't* have "genital dysphoria" early in their transition---focusing instead on things that are more apparent socially, like your face, hair, and clothes---but then, after years, they reach a point where they pass as females for the most part *except* for their penis, at which point it starts to bother them. It's the one thing that remains out of place.

However, even if a trans woman doesn't have an inner, psychological feeling of wrongness from associating her penis with being a man or whatever---or if she does feel that way but it's not *that* compelling a reason on its own, or it's something she could live with---there are other factors that play into the motivation. And in my case, and in the case of other trans women I've known, these other factors are significantly larger.

### **1. Clothes**

It's not easy clothes shopping for yourself if you feel like your dick is a secret that nobody is supposed to see bulging anywhere. It's not impossible to wear tights or tight-fitting pants, but it's uncomfortable and 'dangerous' (if you mess up). It also means good luck going out in a bikini or to a tool. It just makes everything awkward.

This might sound kind of frivolous, but the feeling that women's clothes don't work on you is bothersome, alienating, restricting. "This is supposed to the women's section---but I'm trans, so I can't realistically buy a lot of these things." It really makes you feel like you don't fit in. And finally having a lot of freedom in what you buy (and wear) was a significant benefit enjoyed by friends of mine after their surgeries. It was something they talked about glowingly for weeks.

### **2. Other women's comfort**

There are some women who are over it and don't particularly care if a trans woman has a penis. She's still a woman, she's still one of us, she's still our sister, feminism, woo, all that. But look, a lot of women just really don't like penises. The thought of somebody who has a penis being around them makes them uneasy. They really do think of the lady's room as the "no dicks allowed" room.

There are *many* women---who are not especially bigoted or ideological or political, but just normal normies---who feel okay  letting post-op trans women into their space, but feel very uneasy letting trans women who still have penises into their space. This might not bother every trans woman---but it should. Because cis women's comfort should matter to us. I don't just want to force myself in where people don't accept me. It's their space that I'm *asking* to be let into. I think on some level, having a penis makes women register you as a sexual threat. Losing your penis is like declawing a cat, or taking the ammo out of a gun. It makes you safe.

Another aspect of it might be that they consider getting bottom surgery to be the final proof that you're on their team. There's a paranoia that somebody could just be faking it, right? What if I say I'm a trans woman, but then I pull my dick out and go back into man-mode and harass you with it? That's how some people think. But if I'm at the point where I got rid of my dick, there's no question about my intentions and what team I'm on here. It's like the final test of your loyalty to womanhood.

## **3. Feeling like you're hiding something**

Have you ever snuck through a border checkpoint with contraband you're hoping the police don't find? No, and I suppose most people haven't, but imagine it. Have you ever shoplifted? Look, the point is, feeling like you have something to hide sucks. It wears on you mentally. I hate feeling scared when I use women's washrooms because it's like I'm going to get in trouble or freak somebody out if they see me.

This feels related to the previous point, but it's not the same. The previous point was about the impact you have on others, while this one is about the impact that feeling like you have something to hide has on you.

Relatedly, I'd love to go to one of those women's-only nude spas at some point, but it feels like that's impossible to do as a pre-op trans woman without accidentally creating a national news story. The social expectation for most normal people is that it's vaginas-only. If I had a vaginoplasty, I could actually feel confident going to something like that.
