# India |2024-03-04

The disagreement, which played out very publicly, on the American right wing earlier this year about H-1B visas, triggered a flare-up of anti-Indian racism. If you browsed social media at that time, you could hardly avoid white people talking about how much they hate Indians, talking about curry, poor English skills, tech support, making fun of Indian stereotypes about being bad at sex or flirting, or in a few memorable cases going on deranged rants about how Indians are mentally inferior and do their jobs by memorizing a flow-chart of algorithmic instructions they carry out without a deep understanding of what they're doing or why, like ant following a pheromone trail.

But this prejudice has been around for a while. It just keeps getting louder. It feels to me like people don't learn racism is bad in general so much as they learn to stop being racist against a specific group of people. They learn about and humanize black people, and they start to reason about the problem with holding individual people to the prejudice of group averages, and eventually they come to believe that racism against black people is bad---but then Chinese people come along, and it starts over, until they learn that racism against Chinese people is bad. They don't transfer these lessons between groups.

India has about twice the population of Europe. It has more than four times the population of the United States. That's 340 million in the US, 740 million in Europe, and over 1.4 billion in India. In the 1940s, two regions that used to be part of India broke off to form their own much smaller countries, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Just those two countries have more people than the US. And though India's total land area is less than Europe, it's still a lot bigger than many people seem to realize. It stretches from London to Moscow, from Athens to Oslo. To stereotype or hold generalizations about this country is kind of insane. It would be like meeting somebody from Portugal, interpreting that as "Europe", and talking about the corruption in Moldova, or saying you went to Europe one time and the people weren't very talkative, because you went to Finland.

India, like Europe, is a combination of many different pieces.

There is no Indian language or Indian accent, any more than there's a European language or accent. They have hundreds of languages---more than Europe. They also have more religious diversity. India was the birthplace of four major world religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism), and they have been influenced significantly by Islam, after Muslims came to the region from the Middle East in the 13th century. To this day, India has over 200 million Muslims, making it one of the top countries in the world by Muslim population.

In 1947, the Muslim population broke away from the rest of India, forming Pakistan and Bangladesh; before that, for hundreds of years, India---though the name 'India' was not officially used---was a land of religious pluralism, with Muslims, Hindus, and other groups working alongside one another in government, and the emperor patronizing multiple religions. Akbar, one of the early Mughal emperors (whose name is actually a title, meaning 'the great', which you might recognize from the phrase 'Allah Akbar'---similar to how the first Roman emperor became known as 'Augustus', which was just a title that meant 'the great' or 'the majestic') was said to have personally held an unusual combination of religious belief, as he oversaw the expansion and centralization of the empire that Europeans would come to know. And as the Mughal empire, India was briefly the wealthest place on Earth in the modern period, before the British Raj, taking the title from China (though it would later go back to China).

It was near the end of Akbar's reign that British traders first landed in India, in the late 1500s. It was in the year 1600 that Elizabeth I of England signed a royal charter to create the infamous joint-stock corporation, the East India Company. The English hadn't arrived in Asia as conquerors, but as humble traders. They couldn't have conquered anybody---they were smaller, less wealthy, less powerful, and far from home, in the domain of powerful, wealthy, centralized Asian empires. The English had to seek permission from the Indian emperor to trade on his land, and meet his demands to attain that permission---for example, a ban on Christian missionaries. It wouldn't be until over 100 years later that England even began having any real power in the region, as India started going through their own 'fall of Rome' that created opportunity for new alliances to appear.

When that happened, and India itself became divided, many Indian governors would ally with British and French officers rather than with other Indian states. By this point, Europeans had been there for generations---there was not a harsh divide that made them be viewed as 'foreigners', nor a unified 'Indian' identity among the rest of the subcontinent.

Europe, and Britian especially, was significantly affected by this imperial relationship with India. We purchased their goods, textiles, dyes, tea (before the British were associated with tea, coffee was the drink of choice, but a changing world economic landscape that made coffee more expensive followed by Indian tea being in plentiful supply got most of the country to change over, and Britons have been portrays as tea-drinkers ever since), and there was a mutual interest in each other's culture. Indian writers and artists travelled to England and vice versa, and there was mutual admiration. As some historians describe, India became something of a laboratory for European governance, and numerous things that are now normal to us---like our public school systems, or the very notion of a public cemetary---originate among British governors in India.

However, there was also chauvinism on the part of many Britons, who viewed their culture as better than the culture of India. Part of the reason this was asserted is to *justify* British rule. Why is Britain ruling over this other country? It's a question the public would want an answer to, and Britain had by this point in time a self-image of being enlightened country that would deliver good governance, and the saving faith of Christianity. To fulfil this narrative, they had to believe that India without them would be terribly mismanaged, and one of the ways they did this was by outlawing certain types of barbarism, most famously sati.

Sati (sah-tee) was presented to the public as an ancient, ritualistic practice wherein if a married man died, the town would get together and put his body on a funeral pyre, and then throw his wife onto it too, burning her alive. Why in the world would any culture do something like this? It sounds so obviously stupid and antithetical to any kind of stable community. There could be a bizarre religious justification---Europe has had its own share of grim practices, mind you---but the point is, no European person had ever actually witnessed such a thing happening. It was something they heard rumours of, and then proudly declared they would forbid going into the future. This was presented as a moral victory, of sorts---an example of a problem that Britain had solved. And the legacy of this propganda---the notion that Indians were burning women alive before the British came and put a stop to it---lives on in people's minds to this day, hundreds of years later.

In these intervening years, religious tension in India grew, largely as a result of British policy meant to pit them against each other. Divide and conquer---everywhere that Britain ruled, they identified the groups within the population, granted privileges to one over the other, and tried to play them against each other. They would prefer, for instance, if instead of everybody uniting against the British, the Muslims would view the Hindus as a greater threat to them, and for the Muslims to cozy up with the British government against the Hindus instead. But this being the attitude of the ruling class for so many generations contributed to the religious divide that exists in India today.

$As time went by, and the world economic system changed to be one largely of free trade between nations, the benefit of maintaining large empires was decreasing, while the cost of doing so was increased---because people grew discontent with being ruled from afar, started becoming more interested in local autonomy. Even if opposition to colonial rule *could* be topped---and in the beginning, they were---eventually it may end up being so expensive to contiually do so that it's just not worth it anymore. In the 1900s, Britain was at peace with the reality that their empire was not going to last forever, and they shifted to building diplomatic ties and developing what we now know as the Commonwealth. It was also this century that Canada would gain full independence, likewise without any great fight by England.

The fight for independence being taken up by Gandhi, who led a nonviolent resistance, had a significant influence on the West and how we see protest and political change. He became admired in Britain, America, and really everywhere. He was cited directly as an influence on the US civil rights movement and their methods. But Gandhi was never the political leader of India, so despite the influence that he had in pushing India toward independence, he isn't the best person to study if you want to understand India as a country during this period.

In India, as in so many other countries in the 20th century, there was great interest in socialism. Jawaharlal Nehru (juh-waa-huh-lawl nay-roo), an Indian man who studied law in England, attended Cambridge, and travelled across Europe, including to the Soviet Union, returned to India and became involved in politics in the 1920s, before independence, and would end up leading India as the country's first Prime Minister after independence in 1947, a position he held until his death in 1964. It was Nehru, more than anybody else, who molded the India we know today.

When India was in the process of becoming independent, it also underwent partition. The Muslim population of India, led by the great Muhammad Ali Jinnah, believed that after the British left, the Muslim population would be marginalized in a Hindu-majority India, and that for their own sake, the Muslims ought to declare independence, creating Pakistan. Jinnah died in 1948, only a year after his vision came reality, and he is now revered in Pakistan as father of the nation. There were calls in India to pursue a similar path and become an explicitly religious country, a Hindustan. Nehru rejected this. Nehru was a not religious man, though he was from a Hindu family, and he believed that India was home to many different peoples and religions, including Muslims. Despite their new neighbours declaring their countries Islamic states, Nehru stood as a defender of secularism, religious pluralism, and humanism.

Nehru and his party were socialists, but they deliberately avoided aligning too strongly with either side during the Cold War, which is probably why many in the West don't associate India with socialism, despite this being one of the express goals of their government for decades. Nehru didn't full agree with the Marxist approach that had taken over Russia, and later China. What he did believe in was national independence, and democracy. Whereas in Russia, China, and other Second World-aligned countries, Communist parties came to power by coup and crushed any semblance of democracy, Nehru was always freely and fairly elected, and instead of taking the excuse that India wasn't ready for democracy---because most of its population was illiterate, living in rural areas with no knowledge of politics---they sought to change their conditions, massively improving their literacy rate and organizing groups to go across the country, village by village, educating people about government, elections, and providing information about political parties and candidates. This undertaking is not as widely known of and celebrated as it should be, and it's the reason that today India can boast being the world's largest democracy.

The next big leader of India after Nehru was Indira Gandhi, who first became Prime Minister in 1966 (she was of no relation to Mahatma Gandhi---there were other families with that surname). The "Iron Lady", now largely associated with Margaret Thatcher, was first a term applied to Indira, while she dominated Indian politics with landslide victories and strong support by her party, some calling it the Indira Raj. It was around the beginning of her tenure that India went through its own Green revolution, as high-yield variety seeds and mechanized farming equipment massively increased agricultural output, changing the country's economic landscape. India was trying to balance economic interests with their goal of sovereignty and self-sufficiency, which a modernizing economy appeared to threaten as the world began to transition into the neoliberal policies of the 1970s, foreign companies began investing in Indian agriculture, and control of land and capital began accumulating to the detriment of the small farmer.

Indira Gandhi's rule was cut short when she was assassinated in 1984 by Sikh men who had been working as her body guards. Sikhism is a minority religion in India, commonly associated with their turbans and beards, which are considered holy in the Sikh religion. (A brief note, before I move on: what is the correct pronunciation of Sikh? Is it sick, or seek? I've long heard it said seek, but then at some point I met Indian people who pronounced it sick, and then I met some sikhs who pronounce it seek, and then later I met more sikhs who say it was originally pronounced sick, but then people started calling it seek in the English world, including seeks who live here. It might be that it's pronounced sick in India, but then in English it's pronounced seek, including by seeks, for some reason. I am going to call it seekism simply because that's how I'm accustomed to saying it, but be aware

. They make up about 1 and a half percent of India's population---though for perspectives, that's still tens of millions of people, a few million more than the population of some mid-sized countries like Romania, Chile, or the Netherlands. Often overlooked for being far smaller than the Hindu or Muslim populations, the Sikh population is most concentrated in the northern Indian region called the Punjab. There is a Sikh nationalist movement which calls for this region, the only place in the world where Sikhs are the majority, to be given political independence in the same way that Pakistan was. They refer to this proposed region as Khalistan, derived from *Khalsa*, which refers to followers of Sikhism who have been properly initiated, kind of like if there were a term for Christians who have been baptized? It comes from the sanskrit word for 'pure'. I mention this is because the Khalistan movement is relevant to modern politics: if you heard about how the Indian government had a man in Canada in 2023, named Hardeep Singh Nijjar, it's because this man was a Sikh leader who supported the Khalistan movement, which the present-day Indian government strongly opposes.

The Sikh religion is interesting, but I'm not going to expand on their beliefs here. The important note is there's a holy 


The important part is there's a called the golden temple, which is the holiest place in Sikhism---and which, yes, is literally gold (not pure gold, but that's real gold leaf). There were people who were wanted by the Indian government, and they hid in this temple, but Indira Gandhi signed the order to have the army attack the place, despite its religious significance. They also attacked various other Sikh temples. The Sikhs were armed and fought back, and it became a huge problem. If you're interested in more about that, search for Operation Blue Star.
