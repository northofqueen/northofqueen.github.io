# India |2024-02-28

India has twice the population of Europe (700 million vs. 1.4 billion) and though it's not as large by total land area, it's way bigger than some people realize---it stretches from London to Moscow, from Oslo to Athens. To stereotype and generalize about this enormous country is insane. It would be like meeting a person from Portugal and just interpreting that as "Europe" and then talking about corruption in Moldova.

There is no Indian language or Indian accent, any more than there's a European language or accent. They have hundreds of languages---more than in Europe. They also have more religious diversity, being the birthplace of four major religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism) and with a history of influence by Islam after Muslims came to the region from the Middle East in the 13th century.

In 1947, the Muslim population broke away from the rest of India, forming the countries of Pakistan and Bangladesh; but before that, for hundreds of years, India was a country of religious pluralism, with Muslims, Hindus, and other groups working alongside each other in government, and the emperor patronizing multiple religions. Akbar, one of the great emperors of Indian history, was said to personally believe a strange combination of various religions ('Akbar' was an imperial title often translated as 'the great'---like how the first Roman emperor became known as 'Augustus', but that just meant 'the majestic' or something).

As the Mughal Empire, India was briefly the wealthiest place on Earth in the modern period, before the British Raj. (The country wasn't officially called 'India' until 1947, before which *India* had long been used as a general term for the Indus valley region---hence why the West Indies are called that.) In the late 1500s, when British traders first arrived in India, they didn't arrive as conquerors, because they couldn't have been---they were far smaller, less wealthy, less powerful, and far from home. They had to approach the emperor and ask him for permission to trade in his land, and one of the conditions for that was a ban on Christian missionaries. It wasn't until over 100 years later that England even began having any real power, as India started going through their own 'fall of Rome' that created opportunity for new alliances to take over.

In the 20th century, there was great interest by Indians in socialism, especially after their independence, with Indians admiring the Soviet Union and Karl Marx---but in India they were more genuinely committed to democracy, and instead of crushing the beginnings of their democratic system as the Russians and Chinese did, they built it up, travelling across the country and educating people about government, elections, and their political parties. Today India boasts being the world's largest democracy.
