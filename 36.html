# **People don't really have world views**

Here's what I believe is a valuable realization: some people only fight for good because they think the good guys are the winning team. They join us in hating on the bad guys---the Confederates, Nazis, commies, fascists, or whatever---but mainly because they think of those groups as the (historical) losers. They side with our ideas, of liberty of justice, but not because they have a solid foundation for believing those ideas are good. They just feel that our ideas have been vindicated by our historical victories. If what we consider evil today were to triumph, a lot of normal people would shrug and join them.
