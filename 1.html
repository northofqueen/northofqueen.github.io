### **Spelling differences**

How many American--British spelling differences can you think of? Here are main ones I know of:

||table
labor / **labour** | center / **centre** | **estrogen** / oestrogen | dialog / **dialogue**
canceled / **cancelled** | **organize** / organise | check / **cheque** | jewelry / **jewellery**
**license** / licence | fulfills / **fulfils** | **paralyze** / paralyse

There are many more, but most are just going to be essentially the same as these (e.g. the colour vs. color spelling difference is just another form of the labor vs. labour difference).

I always have to break in new spell-check software because I deliberately spell some things in the British way and some things the American way. I bolded my preference above. I originally learned all the British spellings, then gradually adopted some American spellings whenever I felt that way seemed better. 'Organize' *is* said with a Z-sound, and 'oestrogen' *does* look archaic and doesn't match how the word is said, and it makes sense to put an 's' in 'defence' because we end up putting it there anyway when the word is conjugated to 'defensive'.

I still write 'colour', despite all the forces of software development trying to force me to spell it 'color' (because nobody can be fucked just adding it as an alias). There's also a few things I swap back and forth on randomly, like the pronunciation of zed, or zee. I don't know; either is fine.

The main reason we have language rules is for clearness of meaning. If you use the wrong word, you end up communicating the wrong message. But sometimes, there's no real way to misinterpret what's being said. It just sounds wrong to our ear for some reason. That applies to pronunciation, but also to weird things, like how "little old lady" is more correct than "old little lady". How do I explain that to somebody learning English? I don't know. But if I were learning a language, my goal is to sound like the people who speak the language, so if they told me "because nobody says it that way", I guess that'd be good enough for me.

We have to balance that with appreciating the natural evolution of language. If you know what you're doing, then doing things *differently* could very well be doing it *better*, and maybe a century from now that will be what's normal. That's where a lot of our current words came from, obviously. It has to start somewhere. Words can also shift around and change over time. We squish words together, we change how they're spelled, sometimes we randomly swap letters around. There are many common words, like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'myself', and 'another', that used to be multiple words (to day, to morrow, my self, an other), then we hyphenated them, then eventually we stopped bothering with the hyphen and they became standalone words. I still see 'percent' written as 'per cent' sometimes, and I remember noticing all the 'to-day's and 'to-morrow's when I was young and reading *Pride and Prejudice* for the first time (fuck any version that modernizes the spelling).

I noticed other little relics, like 'connection' being spelled as 'connexion'. It turns out that used to be normal, and for similar words as well, like 'reflection' ('reflexion')---but not for 'perfection', funny enough, which was always spelled without the x. And then you have 'complexion', which is the exception because it didn't lose its x like the others did. Why isn't it spelled 'complection'? According to Wiktionary that spelling was used once in 1534, when English was weird because nothing was standardized yet ("the certayn peculyar nature & complection"), but I guess it didn't stick? Either way, language is full of fun little quirks like this. I sometimes spell things in alternate ways (like 'connexion') just for fun.

I've never understood why people insist 'stupider' isn't a word. Why not? I remember this being a punchline in *Jack Frost*, that stupid 1998 Christmas comedy where the dad turns into a snowman. A kid says 'stupider' and the dad is like, "did you just say stupider? what kind of word is stupider?", and we're supposed to laugh like he just demolished that kid. But it's just an adjective, 'stupid', with an '-er' attached, which is how we make adjectives superlative. It should naturally be the standard way to say 'more stupid'. Instead, there's apparently no word for that? And we just have to say 'more stupid'? Why? Well you know what, forget what those people say---I'll call things stupider if I want.

Have you ever heard somebody pronounce 'ask' as axe? I remember there was a Futurama joke about this, where in the year 3000 everybody pronounces it 'axe' and Fry is seen as weird for still pronouncing it 'ask'. Were they consistent about that, or did it just come up in that one episode? It was the one the Christmas episode where they talk about nuclear winter cancelling out global warming. I don't remember. But I didn't fully get that joke the first time around, because I'd never heard someone say 'ask' that way in real life before. I thought Futurama made it up.

The 'axe' pronunciation has become associated with black people in the United States today. I'm also told it's just how rural Southerners in general pronounce it. If you look it up, though, it's apparently a variant that's been around for a long time, and whether it's been considered 'wrong' or just a variant has varied. There's a similar story about the word *ain't*. I don't know how it came to be, but it used to just be a normal word, until at some point everyone kind of *decided* that it's improper and tried to stamp it out. I grew up being told it was a misspeak and thinking it made you sound uneducated. It strikes me that we seem to be more more critical of 'misspeaking' when it's done by minorities, because Scottish people can say a lot of words differently ('I canny do that') and if someone asks why they say it differently, it's just their accent, and we all kind of shrug and accept that. "That's just how Scottish people say it." But I don't know how many times I've now witnessed a black person saying 'axe' and people 'correcting' them and insisting they're saying it wrong and implying it's because they're too dumb to speak English properly. Why isn't that also just their accent, or dialect, or whatever? After reflecting on it like this, I've come to think that over-correcting black slang is effectively an expression of racism, and I've shared that thought with other people in my life when I hear them engaging in it.

There's a proper name for this type of change (the ask--axe thing): an adjacent metathesis. This means when two letters get swapped around for some reason. It's happened to many words in English before. The example I commonly see cited is 'bird', which used to be spelled 'brid'. It just randomly got switched around into 'bird' for some reason, and nobody really knows why. For most of recorded history, people just wrote things the way they said them, so maybe everyone called things a 'brrd' but disagreed on how to translate that from noises into letters. A brr-id? I don't know. But if you go back in time far enough, at some point the spelling changes over.

Years ago, I made a deliberate choice, and have stuck to it ever since, which is that I write 'theirself' and 'theirselves', instead of the more common 'themself' and 'themselves'. Why? Because it makes more sense. The self is the object in question, and it belongs to them, so it's theirs. It's their self. Theirself. Why do we say 'their car' and 'their hat', but 'themselves'? Imagine how stupid that would sound for anything else. My neighbours let me use them car. What? This may have been around the time everybody started trying to normalize the singular 'they' and it got me thinking about words like that. Another quirk associated with black people is saying 'hisself' instead of 'himself', which is basically the same idea. Why *do* we say 'himself'? If you think about it, 'hisself' does make more sense. It's interesting when these colloquial changes associated with uneducated people are actually sort of logical. Conversely, some people say 'they' instead of 'their'---as in, "Some people are bad at they jobs." That doesn't make more sense in any way. That's just being lazy. So hey, it's not all good.

Why do people capitalize 'black' these days? No, I sort of get the reasoning. But do we capitalize white, too? Traditionally these weren't capitalized because they're just descriptors, like blonde, or tall, or funny. There is no proper noun. These aren't organizations. Then people just randomly started capitalizing it in 2020 (and declaring their intent to do so: [1](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/time-to-capitalize-blackand-white/613159/) | [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/insider/capitalized-black.html) | [3](https://apnews.com/article/71386b46dbff8190e71493a763e8f45a)) when there were protests in the United States following the murder of George Floyd, right as everybody on social media were [changing their profile pictures to black squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_Tuesday). It felt very much like a weird form of, like, giving black people a consolation prize. "Hey buddy, we hear the police are being mean to you. How about we capitalize your word?" To add to the comedy, many people refused to also capitalize white, pretending there's a difference (even some [serious sources](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/capital-b-black-styleguide.php) did this). Not for you, white man!

I don't bother capitalizing either word because (1) I'm not used to doing so, and I don't really see what advantage would be offered by making these changes; (2) the people who changed over seemed like they were doing so out of a pointless and deep-seated racist guilt, which I don't relate to and don't generally find a good thing to validate; and (3) if we accept this then I don't know why people won't just start capitalizing other things too, like Disabled, or Gay, or---hey, what about Transgender? We're a population. A group. An identity. I literally don't see why not, if any group name gets one. That just seems like a dumb, pointless road to go down. The intuitive rule is that the capitals are for things that relate to proper nouns. I'll stick with that.

### **Slang**

As a 'millennial' (b. 1994), my peers use 'zoomer' to mean young people, and now it's become a point of pride to talk about 'zoomer slang' and how dumb it is, like our slang was so much better. But that's just a survival bias, right? I assume every generation develops its own language, and some of it will be good and stick around, and some of it will be fuckin' stupid. But I'm also not sure that people credit these terms properly. Is all new slang that's come about in the last 10 years created by zoomers? That doesn't seem right. Millennials are still young (supposedly the current age range is 28--45) and constantly online in ways that overlap with people younger than us. It probably makes more sense to think of slang itself as going through generations.

Here's relatively modern slang I enjoy:

- **mid** -- An adjective, used to call something average or okay, but with a more negative connotation (the difference between saying "it could've been worse" and saying "it could've been better")
- **aura** -- Similar to stage presence, this is using 'aura' (dictionary definition) with a positive connotation to imply confidence, charm, charisma -- "she has an aura"
- **aura points** -- Wait a minute, no, I don't enjoy this, but 'aura' led to people talking about 'aura points', meaning how much aura you have, that's fuckin' dumb
- **vibes** -- Does this even count anymore? I feel like everybody I know has adopted vibes as part of their vocabulary. It describes the general feel, association of a thing -- kind of like aura, but more commonly used with a modifier, or an emphasized article (it's "a vibe")
- **it's giving ___** -- Think "it's giving off" or "it's giving the impression or feel of", or perhaps better yet "it's giving ___ (vibes)", but cutting out the unnecessary words -- generally used to say what a thing reminds you off, and typically used negatively ("it's giving breakup", or fashion-focused advice, "it's giving divorced soccer mom")
- **mood** -- A one-word reply, meaning "I feel this" -- e.g. somebody posts a picture or says something you relate to, you just reply "mood"; can also be used in conversation: somebody says something you relate to, you say "mood"
- **bet** -- Used as an affirmative response, the same as "you bet" -- implicitly, "you can bet on that being true"
- **hits different** -- Is this zoomer slang? I'm not sure when people started saying it, but I say it all the time now, and I didn't used to. It just means an experience is modified under certain conditions. "it hits (you) different(ly when...)"

Terms I wish people should stop saying: bussin, cap, yeet, sus, rizz (this one isn't objectively bad, but it just feels icky to me). I also can't stand a lot of language associated with gay and drag culture. There's a disgusting new trend where people use the word 'cunt' as an adjective (as in "that's so cunt"), and a term where people describe somebody as "serving cunt", which means to be charismatic or captivating in a feminine way. Please, queer people, for the love of god, be normal. Just because we're gay doesn't mean we have to try and gross out the straights, okay?
