John Ratcliffe) were accused of using Signal for high-level discussions not appropriate for an unclassified, commercial platform. Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe testified no classified material was shared,[](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/atlantic-publishes-full-signal-chat-messages-showing-military-plans-us-rcna198148) so the Atlantic published the whole thing.[](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/)

D.C. appellate judge Patricia Millett observed "There's no regulations, and nothing was adopted by the agency officials that were administering this. They people weren't given notice. They weren't told where they were going. ... [They] had no opportunity to file habeas or any type of action to challenge the removal under the AEA."[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=120094673) In some cases the deportations are based on accusations involving tattoos.[](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5341544/ice-el-salvador-jerce-reyes-barrios)
