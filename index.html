**About me:** I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm white and from a British family. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm <span class="rendered_digit" id="age"></span> years old. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I've been a very political person since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives. I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. The great fight of this age seems to be Western institutions and truth vs. extremism and conspiracy theorismâ€”and since I value institutions and truth, that places me on the 'left', at least in terms of how most people interpret things.

**This page:** I'm using this to host things I write or create. I made every aspect of it in notepad. There's no server software; each page just pulls from the same JavaScript files, which add the layout and styling and formats the body text. It's unusual, but I like that it means pages run the exact same way when run locally. The black fade-in is literally to hide the split second before the styling loads.

Other places I post things:

- **Bluesky:** [https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- **Tumblr:** [https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- **Discord** server I run: [https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2)
- **Substack** -- there's no paywall or unique content, it's just another place I put stuff from here: [https://northofqueen.substack.com](https://northofqueen.substack.com)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X/Twitter.
