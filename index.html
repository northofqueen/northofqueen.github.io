## Info

I'm Iris. This is a simple repo I use to host things I make. It's like a blog, sort of, or maybe like Google docs. I don't know, whatever.

I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I'm a trans woman. I'm a very political person, and many pages here are political commentary. I'd describe myself as a centrist, or a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism.



#### **Other places to find me:**

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social) | [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com) | [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be on Reddit a lot, but I barely use that place at all anymore. I just get banned from every subreddit.

The painting I use for my icon is called [a beauty holding a bird](25.html). Every other image used across the site is visible at [/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images).

The fancy-looking font I used for that header image is called [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine).
