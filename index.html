#### **This repo**

Salut. I'm Iris. I made this repo to host things I make. I tried a lot of blogging sites and wasn't fully satisfied with any of them. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account. I like Tumblr, but I wished it was more easily indexed and navigated. I eventually just started making my own, and a friend pointed out that you can throw static pages here instead of making a wordpress or something.

There's no server software; each page just pulls from the same JavaScript file that adds the layout and styling. It's unusual, but it means that it runs the same way locally as it does online, which pleases me for some reason. I might change how it works in the future, because right now it's like the code version of redneck engineering. I just duct taped files together and said there, it works.

I don't care if you copy any of what I do code-wise; consider it fully open source. I'd only care about people copying my actual writing and claiming to be the author. Is there an MIT license but for literature? I don't know, whatever, but that probably makes my wishes clear enough.

#### **About me**

I live in Canada. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I've been a very political person since I was a teenager when I started reading about economics. I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives. Today I'm very interested in applied ethics and political philosophy.

I would describe myself as a conservative social democrat, or a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in the current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from fully getting along in many left-wing circles either.

#### **Some other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)

There's no unique content on the substack. That's just another place I push content. Like every anxious developer, I like redundancy.



I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. Fuck those places.
