## Info

#### **This repo**

I use this to host things I make. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account---or something like Tumblr, but more easily indexed and navigated.

If it ever goes wrong, I'll probably try and make my own separate website at this point.

#### **About me**

I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan.

I've been a very political person since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. Today I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in the current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from fully getting along in many left-wing circles either.

I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be super active on Reddit, but I basically don't use it at all anymore. That place sucks now and I just get banned from every sub.

#### **Resources**

I made everything here myself in notepad. There's no server software; each page loads from the same JavaScript file, which adds all the layout and styling dynamically. I might change how it works in the future, because right now it's like the code version of redneck engineering. I just duct taped files together and said there, it works.

I don't care if you copy any of what I do code-wise. Consider that open source. I'd care if people were copying my actual writing, but only if they claimed to be the author, like the MIT license.

Fonts used on the page:

- Georgia and [Georgia Pro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia-pro) for the article body text
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for headers
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for small text/dateline
- citation list is in Verdana
- sidebar is your default system-ui font, probably Segoe UI
- [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine) is that fancy-looking font I used to make the header image

That old painting I use for my icon is called "[A beauty holding a bird](25.html)". Every image used is visible at [https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images)

I should add a dark-mode button.

- Israel as a country does have a compelling, heroic narrative â€” a powerless, persecuted minority groups, victims of one of the most atrocious genocides ever, that the most powerful Western countries *still* didn't care about despite just liberating them from the Nazis, came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance to create their own space where they could be safe. They were predictably attacked, but they fought and won, carving out a home for theirselves in their historical region, despite being surrounded on all sides by extremist lunatics who want to murder every single one of them. It makes sense they won a lot of Western support because of this being their position in the region.
- In the beginning, I don't think the way Israelis tried to establish their state was bad. It was just imperial territory, they pursued diplomacy with the leading empires, they got Britain to commit in the 20s to giving them a section of land, and they purchased a bunch more. Jews moved into areas that were completely undeveloped and started developing their own communities from nothing. The way people retell this now makes it sound like there used to be a country called Palestine and Jews just showed up and stole half of it, but there wasn't a country there, it was mostly empty land, with some sparse villages, like the population of one small city stretched out across the whole region. Then the Jews agreed to settlement deals that would have split it between the two populations, they didn't insist on maintaining everything they started with. If everything had gone according to the original plan, it wouldn't have really stood out in history as that bad an event. To our modern sensibilities it does seem unfortunate that people were forcibly displaced from the region after the 1947 war, though this is something everybody opposed a lot less in the past. There were forced relocations happening in Europe that decade, so this didn't really stand out as a unique evil in the world, especially since it wasn't about race or extermination or whatever, it was about pushing out a small population of people who wanted your group all dead. It obviously sucks for the people affected by it, though. Not so badly that I'd expect there to still be conflict raging about the displacement 70 years later, but still.
- The reason things went so badly in the 40s and it turned into war and expulsions, is basically the same reason all the proposed peace deals and partitions since then have fallen through, which is the Arab side only wants to fight, they accept no deal or compromise, they just want every single Jew gone and Israel destroyed. Israel by comparison has been very compromising, accepting partitions and being willing to give up territory. To this day, I still think the overall motive of their actions (blockading Gaza, maintaining a military presence in the West Bank) continues to be self-defensive in the sense if they were to completely leave these regions to their own devices, they wouldn't just develop into normal countries, they would fall back into being ruled by little Jihadi extremist groups that do everything they can to wage war against Israel. Israel would just leave these places and end the blockade if there would be peace instead of them
