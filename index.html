## North of Queen | Info

#### **This repo**

I use this to host things I make. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account---or something like Tumblr, but more easily indexed and navigated.

If it ever goes wrong, I'll probably try and make my own separate website at this point.

#### **About me**

I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan.

I've been a very political person since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. Today I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in the current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from fully getting along in many left-wing circles either.

I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be super active on Reddit, but I basically don't use it at all anymore. That place sucks now and I just get banned from every sub.

#### **Resources**

I made everything here myself in notepad. There's no server software; each page loads from the same JavaScript file, which adds all the layout and styling dynamically. I might change how it works in the future, because right now it's like the code version of redneck engineering. I just duct taped files together and said there, it works.

I don't care if you copy any of what I do code-wise. Consider that open source. I'd care if people were copying my actual writing, but only if they claimed to be the author, like the MIT license.

Fonts used on the page:

- Georgia and [Georgia Pro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia-pro) for the article body text
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for headers
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for small text/dateline
- citation list is in Verdana
- sidebar is your default system-ui font, probably Segoe UI
- [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine) is that fancy-looking font I used to make the header image

That old painting I use for my icon is called "[A beauty holding a bird](25.html)". Every image used is visible at [https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images)

I should add a dark-mode button.
