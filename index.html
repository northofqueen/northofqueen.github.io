## North of Queen | Info

#### **About me**

I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm interested in software development and politics.

#### **This repo**

I've tried a lot of blogging sites and each of them is lacking in some way or another. A friend suggested I try making my own and hosting it here on GitHub. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account, or something like Tumblr, but more easily indexed and navigated. And in general, I wanted more control over the presentation.

If hosting this on GitHub ever doesn't work out anymore, like if I get in trouble with them somehow, then I'll probably move on to making my own website.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be on Reddit a lot, but I barely use that place at all anymore.

#### **My politics**

I've been a very political person since I began reading about economics and philosophy as a teenager. I remember when it was less decisive and more boring, before social media pumped it into seemingly every aspect of our lives.

I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in our current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from being fully accepted in left-wing circles.

I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I'm a moral anti-realist and non-cognitivist. I care about applied ethics and international politics.

#### **Resources**

I made everything here in notepad. Each page just pulls from the same JavaScript file to add the layout and styling, so there's no server software. I might change how that works in the future, since this is like redneck engineering: webdev edition.

- The painting I use for my icon is called "[A beauty holding a bird](25.html)".
- Every image used across the site is visible at [/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images).
- The fancy-looking font I used for that header image is called [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine).
