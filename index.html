## Info

#### **This repo**

I'm Iris. I use this to host things I make. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account---or something like Tumblr, but more easily indexed and navigated. If it goes wrong, I'll probably try and make my own separate website at this point.

I made everything here myself in notepad. There's no server software; each page just loads the same JavaScript file, which adds the layout and styling. I might change how that works in the future, because right now it's like redneck engineering. I duct taped some files together and said there, it works.

#### **About me**

I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I live in Canada. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I'm a very political person, and I have been since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in the current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from fully getting along in many left-wing circles either.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be super active on Reddit, but I basically don't use it at all anymore. That place sucks now and I just get banned from every sub.

#### **Resources**

Fonts used:

- Georgia and [Georgia Pro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia-pro) for the article body text
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for headers
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for small text/dateline
- Verdana for cite notes and reference list
- the sidebar is in your default system-ui font, so probably Segoe UI
- [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine) is that fancy-looking font I used to make the header image

The painting I use for my icon is called "[A beauty holding a bird](25.html)". Every image used is visible at [https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images)

I should add a dark-mode button.
