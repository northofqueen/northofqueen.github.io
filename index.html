## Info

#### **This repo**

I'm Iris. I'm using this repo to host things I make.

I made everything here in notepad. It's just some pages duct taped together. There's no server software. I might change that at some point, because this isn't the 'proper' way to do things, but for now it works fine.

I don't care if you copy anything here. It's so simple, consider it open source.

#### **About me**

I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I'm a trans woman.

I'm a very political person, and many of the pages here are political analysis. Not all of it is, though.

I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which makes me 'left-wing' in our current age of insanity, though some important differences prevent me from being fully accepted in left-wing circles.

I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I'm a moral anti-realist and non-cognitivist. I care a lot about applied ethics and international politics.

I also think a lot about design, media, writing, and software.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be on Reddit a lot, but I barely use that place at all anymore. I just get banned from every subreddit.

#### **Resources**

The painting I use for my icon is called [A beauty holding a bird](25.html). Every other image used across the site is visible at [/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images).

The fancy-looking font I used for that header image is called [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine).

The body text is mostly in Georgia, but the numberals are in [Georgia Pro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia-pro), which is imported in case your machine doesn't have those files natively.

I think everything else is just your browser's default sans-serif and system-ui.
