## Info

#### **This repo**

I'm Iris. This is where I host things I make. I wanted something like Google docs, but more easily shared and not mixed into my Google account, so I made my own.

I live in Canada. I'm <span id="age"><span class="rendered_digit"></span></span> years old. I'm a transsexual woman. I have been a very political person all my life. I still remember when politics was more fringe and sort of boring, before social media pumped it into seemingly every aspect of our lives.

I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. I don't like extremism or conspiracy theorism, which forces me to be 'left-wing' in our current age of insanity, though important differences prevent me from being fully accepted in left-wing circles.

I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. My family history is white Anglo--Scottish.

#### **Other places I can be found**

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/irispol.bsky.social)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fGdV7x5dk2) (my server)
- [Tumblr](https://forthoseinterested.tumblr.com)
- [Substack](https://northofqueen.substack.com) (no special paid content, just another place I copy things to)

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X-Twitter. I used to be super active on Reddit, but I barely use that place at all anymore.

#### **Resources**

I made everything here in notepad. Each page just pulls from the same JavaScript file to add the layout and styling, so there's no actual server software. Speaking of which, I don't care if you copy anything I do here code-wise; consider it all open source.

The painting I use for my icon is called "[A beauty holding a bird](25.html)". Every image used across the site is visible at [/tree/main/images](https://github.com/northofqueen/northofqueen.github.io/tree/main/images).

The fancy-looking font I used for that header image is called [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine). I import [Georgia Pro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia-pro) for the article body text.
