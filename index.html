**About me:** I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm white and from a British family. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I've been a very political person since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives. I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. The great fight of this decade seems to be Western institutions and truth vs. extremism and conspiracy theorism---and since I value institutions and truth, that places me on the 'left', or at least that's how most people interpret me.

**This page:** I'm using this to host things I write or create. I made every aspect of it in notepad. There's no server software; each page just pulls from the same JavaScript files, which add the layout, styling, and convert the text into elements through an interpreter. That black fade-in is there to hide the split second before the styling loads.

I don't use Facebook, Instagram, or X/Twitter.
