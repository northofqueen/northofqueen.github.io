# **Ilham Omar's controversial comments about Somalia** | 2024-01-28

In which she says, for some reason, that she's working in the US Congress [to represent the interests of Somalia and of her fellow Somalians.](https://twitter.com/MarinaMedvin/status/1751751864167661750) This was controversial because the job of a US politician obviously should not be to represent the interests of some other country. This is called a conflict of loyalty.

**Background:** Somalia is an unstable region that was labelled a 'failed state' in the 1990s as began the Somali Civil War, which was never resolved and is still ongoing. **Somaliland** is an independent region in northern Somalia that emerged out of this conflict and is now operating as an unrecognized country, to the dismay of the rest of Somalia. The various groups in the country are still in violent conflict, but officially Somalia is ruled by the president and military in the capital city of Mogadishu, which is on the opposite side of the country.

In 2024, Ethiopia came to an agreement with Somaliland called a [memorandum of understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Ethiopia%E2%80%93Somaliland_memorandum_of_understanding). Ethiopia, a landlocked country whose access to the ocean is narrowly blocked off by its neighbours, would gain access to the ocean (more specifically the gulf of Aden) in exchange for recognizing Somaliland as an independent state, making Ethiopia the first country to do so globally.

So when Omar references "people who call theirselves Somalis" below, she means the people of that northern independent region of Somaliland. The implication is they're not acting like true Somalians because they're betraying Somalia. She is condemning the MoU (memorandum of understanding), siding with the Somali government in the south.

||transcript
**Omar**: | We, as Somalians, we love each other. There are areas of friction and that led us to kill each other, but in reality we are an organized society, brothers and sisters, people of the same blood, people who know they are Somalians first, Muslims second, who protect one another, come to each other's aid and to the aid of other Muslims too.
**Omar**: | A couple of days ago, we heard some people who call theirselves Somalis have signed an MoU with Ethiopia on access to the sea. Many Somalians have personally called me to encourage me to speak to the US government and help Somalia. They wanted to know what the US government could do for Somalia to ensure the MoU never turns into a full bilateral agreement.
**Omar**: | My answer to Somalians was that the US government will only do what Somalians in the US tells them to do. They will do what we want and nothing else. They must follow our orders and that is how we will safeguard the interest of Somalia. WE Somalians must have that confidence in ourselves that we call for the shots in the US. We live in the US, pay taxes in the US and have a real voice.
**Omar**: | The US is a country where one of your daughters [referring to herself] is in congress to represent your interest, for as long as I am in the US Congress, Somalia will never be in danger, its waters will not be stolen by Ethiopia or others. The US would not dare to support anyone against Somalia to steal our land or oceans. Sleep in comfort, knowing I am here to protect the interests of Somalia from inside  the US system.
**Omar**: | The woman you sent to Congress [referring to herself] is working day and night to protect your interest, she knows your plight and that of Somalia. I am as concerned about Somalia as you guys are. Together we will protect the interests of Somalia.
**Omar**: | President Hassan Sheikh, the current president of Somalia has done a remarkable job in looking after Somalia. Mr. President, you have done an excellent job and we are happy about it. You spoke to Somalians dispersed across the world that you are there to look after Somalia. However weak it [Somalia] is, or if it is a failed state, we Somalians are resilient people who can fight against all odds, people who love their country [Somalia], we are people who will never allow someone else to steal our land.
**Omar**: | Therefore, I congratulate Somalian-Americans and other Somalis across the globe for showing a remarkable level of unity [against Ethiopia and Somaliland]. The way you all rallied behind our president [Hassan Sheikh] because he needs us today. Somalia is for Somalis only, as over 45 percent of Somalia's population are not even ethnic Somalis. Somalia is one nation, we are all brothers and sisters. Our land cannot be divided. Ethiopia and Kenya have stolen and continue to occupy the Somalia Region state, which belongs to Somalia.
**Omar**: | What remains of Somalia cannot be further divided.
|^Ilham Omar's comments were given in Somali and translated to English

Ilham Omar doesn't seem like a bad person and one can understand her having feelings about a conflict happening in Somalia. She was born in Mogadishu in 1982; the civil war broke out when she was a child, leading to her family fleeing to the US. However, this mindset and these public statements about it are totally inappropriate for somebody who's a member of government.
