# **Israel notes** | 2025-02-13

### **Exposition**

Israel--Palestine feels like the most polarizing issue ever. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. How could you not support the only democracy in the Middle East and side with the antisemitic terrorists who rape innocents and use their own people as human shields? No, wait, how could you possibly support the fascist apartheid state that's trying to genocide Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out and having no opinion isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. I'm willing to risk conflict over certain issues---ones where if someone disagrees with me, I'd rather they know, and possibly fuck off---but this one is so unimportant to me in the grand scheme of things, and so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, that it's generally not worth touching. It's safer to avoid the conversation. And I feel that was many other people's approach before the Hamas attack on 2023-Oct-07, which thrust the issue into our view and made having an opinion about it most fashionable. In the last couple years, it seems like popular sentiment has shifted against Israel, and Palestine flags have started showing up seemingly everywhere.

There's legitimate criticism of Israel's current actions, and there are some aspects of Israeli politics I find concerning to say the least (read: entitled religious nonsense). We should be making our support for Israel more conditional, making demands of them, drawing some red lines about what we're comfortable with them doing if they want to stay in our good graces. Their slow expansion into the West Bank seems plainly unjustified, their occupation of the Golan Heights should probably end, and---although it hasn't happened yet---I certainly wouldn't approve of Israel expanding into Gaza, should that happen in the future (that should probably be a red line drawn before it happens). In the worst light, Israel appears similar to Russia, as a country that is annexing territory from its neighbours simply because it can, and should be condemned similarly.

However, anti-Zionist hard-liners have shown me they're often black-and-white thinkers (if you don't want to destroy Israel, you support a genocide of Palestinians) who are extremely biased in their thinking (everything Israel does is viewed through the most critical lens possible, while there is endless charity, compassion, and excuses for the actions of their enemies) who play fast and loose with the facts (timelines, numbers, reliability of reporting, etc.) and language (everything Israel does is genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, fascism, etc.), which they're strongly attached to and insistent on (in order to control the framing of the conversation, they often refuse to proceed to talking about the issue if you don't agree with all the labels they apply to it). For these reasons, I've often found myself in contentious conversations where I'm stuck playing the part of 'Israel defender' simply because the person who is condemning Israel is going so unreasonably about it.

### **Why is this conflict so important?**

It's not callous to pick and choose what things get your attention. There is nobody who talks about every single conflict going on in the world. There are just too many of them. People are dying all over the place. How much attention do you pay to the deadly civil wars happening right now in Myanmar, Yemen, or Ethiopia? How about the drug wars happening between rival gangs in South America, or the thousands who died last year in a war in West Africa between splinters of ISIS and al-Qaeda? The most important conflict in the world right now, both in terms of casualties and of the geopolitical implications of its outcome, is the Russo-Ukraine war, and it's not even close. So the question is, what makes Israel--Palestine so significant? Why are there so many people who talk more about it than anything else?

I've known some people who care dearly about this conflict because they're from the Middle East or relatives who've been affected by it. That's fair. But why do so many random white people seem to make this conflict their number-one political issue? There are many factors.

- The conflict is alluring because it offers an **intersection of various ideological narratives** not present in other conflicts. It's not just a war, but one that invokes how we feel about imperialism, colonialism, racism, religious prejudice, etc.
- We're intrigued by **the connection between early Zionism and European history**. We learn in school about the Jews being victims of the Holocaust, then we learn in the aftermath they went to the Middle East and created Israel. If the war happening in Myanmar had a causal link to something that happened in France, it would be more likely to catch our interest, and we might feel responsible for what's happening there.
- We're aware of the conflict because **our politicians talk about it** and clarify the importance of supporting Israel, calling it our ally. If every election season our politicians felt the need to declare their support for Ecuador, then we might start caring more about whatever it is that's happening down there, because it's like, wait, what are we supporting exactly?
- It's **divisive**. If I was very passionate about my opposition to, let's say, the Taliban, and went out to protest with signs condemning them, everybody walking by would just be like, well, yeah? Who's defending the Taliban? There wouldn't be much of a conversation. The fact people disagree about Israel encourages us to keep talking about it.
- The conflict has been **packaged in a way that makes it feel morally uncomplicated** for some people, and therefore easy to take a stand on. This took rhetorical maneuvering to accomplish, because the conflict has been a messy, complicated back-and-forth between two sides killing each other in a way that has no clear answer and invokes a web of history and religious beliefs. That's why for most of my life, "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline or a simile for a messy situation that's impossible to figure out---but since the Oct-7 attacks, oversimplified rhetoric about Israal has ramped up and convinced an increasingly large crowd of people that figuring out who's in the right is actually a very simple matter. Just say "genocide is bad". If they disagree, it's like, what are you, a genocide defender? The other side attempts a similar thing, except it's "terrorism is bad". What are you, a terrorist sympathizer?

Even though none of this is a measure of the consequences of the conflict for the rest of the world, we can still understand why it's come into our view and has remained so consistently.

## **Competing intuitions**

Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine. You've never heard about it before, you have no bias, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another. If you started examining the conflict right now, or perhaps at a point in time 3 years ago, what would be your initial impression?

It depends. The conflict invites different intuitions depending on who's asking. Here are some possibilities:

#### **1. Choose the side that's less bad.**

- This is how many people who end up being more pro-Israel operate. If there's a war between two sides and we have to choose which to support, a good way to start is to ask which side is less immoral. There are many ways in which Israel come across as less bad than groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. They have a better system of government, they have better laws, they're better on women's rights, they commit fewer atrocities and war crimes, until 2014 they were the only country in the region where homosexuality wasn't illegal. If a normal person looks at Tel Aviv and then at cities in other countries in the region, they might pretty quickly decide what side they want to be on.

#### **2. Choose the side that aligns with us.**

- If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and saying they're willing to work with us, then maybe we should just pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is, apparently, a good ally to the United States. They do good intelligence work, they have a good tech industry. They provide us a good foothold in the Middle East. Prior to trying to examine the conflict itself, a person might just decide supporting Israel seems like the rational choice.

#### **3. With great power comes great responsibility, or, a tendency to favour the underdog.**

- If one side of a conflict is far more powerful and wealthy than the other, they're the ones who are really in control and they should ergo be held to a higher standard, and we should be examining the conflict primarily from their perspective. They're holding all the cards. We should also be careful about how much blame we put on people who are oppressed, because they have fewer options, be more desperate, and in cases where an unfair situation goes on for more than a generation, you'll have people being born into this conflict who know no other life, so they lack our modern perspective to guide their own actions. They have agency, but perhaps less culpability.

#### **4. Anti-imperialism, or, bias for the native population.**

- This is more common among the far-left than moderates, but some people look at the conflict and they see Israel as the more foreign country whose population are outsiders to the region, whereas the Palestinians are the people who were there first. This means even before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same land, there is more legitimacy to the Palestinian claim, and ergo Palestinians are more justified in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as part of or an extension of a broader Western colonial project, which further casts it in a negative light. There is a lingering feeling of injustice that comes from the feeling that Israel is itself built on stolen property.
(The less-obvious problem with this view is that the view Israelis are foreigners to the region is factually inaccurate and generally considered to be anti-Israel propaganda, framing the Jewish people as being European or American transplants. From the beginning, there have always been many Israelis of Middle Eastern descent, and today the majority of Jewish people in Israel were born in Israel.)

#### **5. Anti-Americanism, or, Anti-Western bias.**

- This is similar to the previous point, and again a far-left tendency, especially for people who are coming from within the American sphere of influence. They criticize everything through the lens of not wanting America to go around imposing its influence onto the rest of the world, and will therefore tend to view conflicts through the lens of that which does and doesn't support American interests. Israel can be viewed as an extension of American interests, if not a puppet state of the US, a wedge the US is using to divide or destabilize the Middle East for its own purposes. Israel, they reason, should therefore be opposed.

#### **6. Be sensitive to our own prejudice.**

- We all have some bias or another, and some---racism, sexism, xenophobia---can affect how people judge a conflict between parties of different groups. Liberal people try to be aware of common prejudice and compensate for them in our evaluation of things. Not all prejudice is conscious and deliberate, but combatting prejudice generally has to be. If a fight happens at work between a man and woman in a way that seems to make others bias toward the man, we might stop and give extra consideration to the woman's point of view to ensure we're not overlooking her perspective out of sexism (even if a passive, 'accidental' sexism). Would we feel the same way about what happened if their roles were reversed but their actions weren't? If so, why? This kind of self-checking and reflection can be valuable.
If you apply this to Israel--Palestine, there are some ways in which there's a danger of being biased toward Israel: Israeli is more similar to our society, they're more 'Western', many Americans are prejudiced against Muslims, we also tend to like wealthier people over poorer people, and Israelis are generally thought of or depicted as being more racially 'white' than the Arabs (this isn't really true---many Israelis are 'non-white'---but it's still part of how many people conceptualize the conflict). So automatically, we should place a higher level of scrutiny on the Israelis, to compensate for the ways in which we might just be being prejudiced against the other side.

#### **7. Anti-Jewish bias, or, Anti-Semitism.**

- An unfortunate reality Jewish people face is being the perpetual victims of conspiracy theories. In the West, this has been present in people's views of Israel for decades---from speculation about the USS *Liberty* (a US Navy ship that was attacked by Israel in error during the 60s), to the notion that Israel somehow caused or had something to do with the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, to the idea that Israel is to this day somehow calling the shots of American foreign policy through legitimate advocacy work by organizations like AIPAC. In the United States, a non-zero portion of people oppose doing anything to support Israel because they view Israel not as an ally that can help serve US interests, but instead as a bunch of sneaky Jews who are somehow working to manipulate or undermine US interests.

Which way of thinking do you find most appealing?

---

By this point, I feel that I've given consideration to many different angles and arguments surrounding this conflict, but walking into it for the first week or so, the two intuitions that affected me most were **choose the side that seems less bad** and **be sensitive to our own prejudice**. To start with the first, it seemed to me that Israel generally had the moral high ground, a conclusion I came to through a few simple observations:

- The Arab factions are generally pseudo-fascist extremists who expressly want to any region they rule over to be a repressive totalitarian theocracy, whereas Israel is governed more in line with a middling European democracy, letting their own people vocally criticize them, form opposition parties, and not oppressing women and homosexuals.
- If there was a total victory for the Arab factions, there would be a second Holocaust, they would murder every single Jew in Israel. What does Israel want to do that is comparably bad? I wasn't sure. Taking territory, I guess? It didn't seem *as* bad.
- In the conflicts between Israel and Arab factions, the Arabs were willing to act far worse, commit more heinous war crimes, and generally disregard the lives of their own people. That whole "most moral army of the world" talk might be exaggerated, but the IDF sure doesn't *seem* as bad as the people they're fighting against, who deliberately hide in schools and hospitals, target civilians, rape their victims. Israel is held to a way higher standard.

That seemed to form a reasonable basis for leaning toward Israel. However, I also had some countervailing thoughts. If the way Arabs are being treated is ultimately unjust, does the fact they resort, after decades of injustice, to brutality, justify the initial injustice? Here was a point of disagreement I then encountered with people who were more pro-Israel:

### **Terrorism isn't unique to any population**

If the region where I live were annexed by some other country and we were occupied---or ruled over by a neighbouring state that freely entered our territory at will in a manner that was very close to if not technically an occupation---for a long period of time, and all of us opposed this and wanted it to stop but couldn't overpower this enemy through conventional means and they were unwilling to cede control to us, then my expectation is that my people would eventually become terrorists. Some of them, anyway. Not all of us, not a majority, but some of us. Enough of us that it would pose a problem.

I'm not saying this is good or bad. I mean only to say that large populations are inevitably going to contain a diverse range of psychologies, including people who are more willing than average to engage in what I consider terrible actions. In Nazi Germany, who do you think guarded all the extermination camps? They didn't have to breed those Germans in a lab. They already existed among the population. If a dictatorship arose in any given country, there's going to be some percentage of people who come to support it. And if your country *doesn't* fall to dictatorship, those people would probably just carry on living normal lives, their potential for horrific action never being realized or utilized. They exist among us. Their psychotic nature requires a certain environment to activate it. I sometimes encounter people whom I think this about. "If this guy lived in Nazi Germany, he would've been fine standing guard at Dachau." Haven't you ever met anyone like that?

This is all just to say I feel it's important, as part of our perspective in judging another population, to remember that our potential to do horrific things to one another has not disappeared from the gene pool. We've managed to create peaceful, orderly societies, but we're not inherently special or better in that way. If our societies collapsed, some of us would eventually be terrorists too. There are people in Gaza today who were born there while it was occupied by Israel, and then people who were born after Israel stopped occupying it directly, but while it's under a blockade with a militarized border and periodic excursions into their territory by Israeli militants. This is the only world they've ever known. Then down the street from them, there's a man who identifies the source of all their problems and offers them to join the fight. Of course many of them are interested. The young people of Gaza are being propagandized and radicalized into committing their life to fighting against Israel very early on, and there's not exactly ethics classes in their schools teaching them about how great it is to follow international law.

Are these conditions Israel's fault? If they are, then despite my first intutions about the matter being to side with Israel on the grounds they operate more morally today, Israel's moral superiority can't be the end of the story. Imagine, for comparison, if I were looking at a slave society and I reasoned that the slaves who rebelled did more immoral things than the police who were enforcing slavery, who by contrast had a more rigid code of ethics. That could help us make some kind of immediate, surface-level judgment about which person we'd feel safer having tea with, but it could not speak to whether the conditions of slavery were justified.

So how did we get here? And how did it come to be that a majority of people in the West support Israel, anyway? Let's consider the early Israeli narrative, and the history that led up to Israel's founding.

### **Israel has a compelling, heroic narrative**

I sometimes talk about this and I was at first surprised at how often people would disagree. To me it seemed like something even people who are very critical of Israel should be able to acknowledge. Israel has, at least on paper, a compelling, heroic national story. I feel as though it's not a story that is told as often as it used to be, though. Despite the conspiracy theories, Israel is not great at propagating its perspective and narrative to a Western audience. (Terror groups like Hamas by contrast have been very effective at this.)

The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority group, victims of one of the most terrible genocides ever. Even after having just liberated them from the Nazis, many of the most powerful Western countries didn't care about the Jews. Jewish people didn't feel safe anywhere. What are they to do? They came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance, to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy instead of being forever at the mercy of the ruling majority population of other countries. Predictably they were attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who would prefer to wipe them all out.

Today the 'underdog' mentality benefits the Palestinians, but in the past it more benefited Israel. Look at them on a map, surrounded by much larger enemies who are more numerous in number. And Israel didn't used to have the technological or economic advantages it has today. For decades Israel was the underdog in the Middle East, and much of that time was spent during the Cold War, when the entire world was fighting over democracy versus Communism. They were on our side, the only democracy in the Middle East. Their victories felt like our victories. That's how people alive today who remember those years largely feel about it. They went to war against Hezbollah and Hamas, they came out ahead, then we took down the Berlin Wall, and it all blurs together in the collective memory as a time that it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened. The public was psychologically unprepared for the trauma this would apparently inflict upon them. This firmly secured that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, the Muslims are the ones who aren't on our side, meaning the Jews are the ones who are, because the enemy of my enemy and all that. But if you were born in the late 90s or later, you might barely remember 9/11, not remember the Cold War at all, and none of this really means anything to you. For you, Israel is just some country somewhere that all your politicians weirdly feel the need to mention, and then you hear on the news that they're doing apartheid and racism and ethnic cleansing, and you're like, hey, wait, isn't this terrible? There's a significant generational difference in information and perspective.

## **The history of the conflict**

I'm not an historian. I haven't spent years thoroughly researching this. I'm just doing my best to try and understand the basic timeline of events that led to where we are today, and I'm going to share the understanding that I've come away with.

Even before the rise of Nazi Germany, Jews were not treated well in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904) is considered to have been the Jew who founded modern Zionism by talking about how Jews should all come together and make a country. The case that Jews ought to do this---because they can't trust the Christian countries of Europe to treat them well---would only get stronger over time, and these ideas became all the more potent after his death.

[The Ottoman Empire in 1914][The Ottoman Empire in 1914](images/20-1.png)

As a consequence of the events of World War I (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled most of the Middle East, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides, and Britain helped support an unsuccessful Arab revolt against the Ottomans in 1916. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, British foreign secretary Balfour declared that Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in the Ottoman region of Palestine, where there was already a small Jewish population. His letter of support is now known as **Balfour declaration**.

However, Britain also made conflicting agreements with Arab leaders, who were taking great risk in revolting against the Ottomans, and the British agreed to recognize Arab independence after the war in exchange for their participation. This traces back to a series of communications in 1915--16 that became known as the **McMahon–Hussein correspondence**. 'Hussein' refers to Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi, 1854--1931, the Sharif of Mecca who initiated the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. He detested the Balfour declaration and refused to work with the British after the war, more independent now as the King of Hejaz, a new country ruling over the western strip of the Arabian peninsula that used to be Ottoman territory. This led the British to support Ibn Saud, who conquered Hejaz and took Mecca, leading to the establishment of the modern country of Saudi Arabia.

A civil war meanwhile took place in Turkey while Allied forces occupied Constantinople, leading to a victory by Atatürk and the formation of the modern Turkish republic. I mention this to further emphasize that at this point in time, there was a lot of change happening in the world. Countries were rising and falling, borders were changing, and millions of people were migrating in great number.

After the war, the Levant ended up being controlled by the British and French, who had agreed ahead of time, back in 1916, to partition the area horizontally, with Britain taking the southern part and France the north. This was called the **Sykes--Picot Agreement**. Palestine, then known as Mandatory Palestine, was the region on the western-most part of the British side of the partition, ergo it was the British whom the Jews had to work with to control the area. This was a year *before* the Balfour declaration.

There was then a lull. Jewish people started immigrating into the region, settling new towns, developing farmland, and causing conflict with the Arab population. The British at some point limited how many Jews were allowed to immigrate to the region because they noticed it was causing conflict. Though Jewish people had always existed in the Middle East, a negative reaction to these Jews was exacerbated, at the time, by the perception they were Europeans rather than Middle Easterners, an argument still implicitly made to this day, though it no longer applies. There were a few specific points of tension in the 30s, and then in the 40s violence by Jews against the British.

[ ][A map of the Partition Plan for Palestine, or UN General Assembly Resolution 181, passed in 1947](images/20-2.png)

After World War II, the United Nations stepped in and proposed the 1947 partition plan. It would involve splitting the region, not carelessly in half but with some respect to the existing demography and sociological boundaries. They wanted to allow Jews to have a majority in the region allotted to them so they could be an independent community rather than be ruled by a Muslim majority, per the wishes of the whole movement. Still, the 'Arab state' would have ended up being 99 percent Muslim, while the 'Jewish state' side would only have remained majority Jewish by a a few percentage points.

Despite this, Muslims viewed the partition plan as favouring the Jews, boycotted participation in the negotiations, and refused to accept any partition plan that was proposed. A civil war then broke out, the UN plan was never implemented, and the result was an Israeli victory. Israeli forces, having been attacked for trying to accept an international partition plan that would cede half the territory they originally aspired for, forced hundreds of thousands of Arabs out of the region. In Israel, this was seen as a completion of Israel's war of independence, an assertion of Israeli sovereignty, and an unavoidable reality in the face of people who wanted to dominate and exterminate them. For Palestinians, this became known as **the Nakba**, an act of ethnic cleansing and dispossession that gave shape to the Palestinian identity.

### **How many people were displaced?**

If you look it up on Wikipedia, the estimate given is 750 thousand. That's the size of a reasonably large city today. It's roughly the same population as Seattle. If some kind of political crisis happened that resulted in the United States forcibly removing everybody from Seattle, that would presumably be quite the tragedy and everybody would pay attention. Hurricane Katrina displaced about 1 million people from their homes. And in the case of Palestine, it wasn't just one city, but hundreds of small towns and villages throughout the region. And unlike after a hurricane, they weren't allowed to come back afterwards.

This type of forced relocation is viewed far more negatively in hindsight than it was back then. It feels like something nobody today would even consider as a solution to any problem. But for much of history, the notion that a group of people is intimately or spiritually connected with any given area they happen to inhabit and should never be forced to abandon that was not present in most circumstances. The colonial attitude used to be speaking of native populations like mere obstacles that we sometimes had to pick up and move around in order to secure some broader geopolitical goal. This was happening in Asia, as the India--Pakistan partition took place. Even after World War II, there were massive population transfer in Europe that remade the continent, as borders shifted and Germans were expelled from central and eastern Europe. In the context of the world as it was in 1947, the expulsion of Arabs from much of Israel was not in any way a uniquely immoral outcome, much less an intolerable one. The Arab side refused to accept an international plan, they attacked, they lost, and now they're getting kicked out by the side who won.

Had it been a particularly noteworthy location---like an historical city like Constantinople, or a place of great religious importance like Mecca---then different considerations would likely have been made. But Palestine was more seen as some random plot of land, a name given to a sparsely populated rectangle on the outskirts of an empire that was no more. Its population was not seen as a distinct or special population with their own unique history or identity. They were just considered Arabs who could easily be moved around, and there were numerous other Arab countries they could go to. Forcing them to move was therefore not treated like a monumental travesty. It was more just part of the negotiation, a cost of doing business, all part of the process of trying to end up with borders that worked reasonably well for everybody once the dust settled.

There were many Palestinians who did simply leave, millions of them ending up in Jordan (another country that had emerged out of the Ottoman dissolution), where they settled and became a major part of the Jordanian population. This caused trouble in Jordan, though, where in 1951, Palestinians murdered the first King of Jordan, Abdullah, in response to fears that he may sign a peace treaty with Israel. To this day, the Palestinian population is unfortunately viewed negatively in the rest of the Arab world, not wanted in either Jordan or Egypt due to their propensity for violence and extremism. Whenever we hear about Israel blockading the Gaza strip, remember that Egypt was blockading them too.

### **Is Palestinian an ethnicity?**

What even *is* a Palestinian? In the simplest sense, it's a person who lived in that region. There's debate about the extent to which it was even a thing before the 1940s, though. I'm currently given to believe that if you went back in time, the people who lived there before the 1920s wouldn't have identified as 'Palestinians'. They were Muslim Arabs whose leaders swore loyalty to the Ottomans. There was no particular stress or distinction placed on this location in the way that nationality or ethnicity typically implies.

[ ][This is the part of Ontario that I'm describing](images/20-3.png)

I started thinking about my own country for comparison. Imagine if a political crisis resulted in the political isolation of a chunk of Ontario that wasn't our capital or major urban centres. Let's say that stretch of land north of Lake Huron, from Sault Ste. Marie to Sudbury. Imagine the United States annexed this region, put it under military rule, built a big fence around it, every so often going in to police the region to keep dissidents under control. Would the people in this area henceforth constitute an ethnicitiy? It isn't currently, and it would come across as strange if you today spoke of "the proud Sudburian ethnic group" or something like that. It's just a place in Ontario. There are people there, and some families have been there for generations, and you might meet somebody elsewhere in the country who says they're *from* Sudbury, but nobody talks about this place as though it's a distinct nation or ethnic group. It's by and large the same people and culture you'd find elsewhere in Canada.

However, if this imaginary annexation and subjugation of the territory were to happen, it's possible an ethnic identity would emerge. Though it's often used as though a synonym for genetic identity or racial group, in sociology an ethnicity is any group of people who perceive theirselves as distinct from those not in their group based on any perceived attributes. In theory, it can be a difference in language, culture, history, religion. It doesn't need to be racial. Having a shared experience can be the thing that constitutes an ethnogenesis, meaning the creation of a new ethnic identity. Russians and Ukrainians are not significantly genetically different, but today are different ethnicities due to their history diverging and resulting in linguistic and cultural differences. So even if at some point everybody in the Middle East were just ambiguously Arabs, but then one subset of Arabs were thrown out of their homes and forced to be refugees due to a conflict with Israel, that shared experience, hardship, and trauma can lead to those people forming a shared identity. And this isn't any less 'real' than other identities just because it's one that has emerged more recently in world history.

However, the only reason this matters is because the notion that "Palestinian" is a national identity or ethnic group makes the act of expelling them from their ancestral home of Palestine sound like an even worse action than it would've been otherwise---but again, the impression I get is that it wasn't really a distinct identity *at the time*. They were simply Arabs, not significantly different from the Arabs in all the surrounding territories. The distinction with which we speak of them today formed after, and in response to, Israel's national independence. If we're giving special attention to land claims that accompany distinct identities, I don't think our condemnation about that should apply *ex post facto* to a case where the expulsion is the reason the identity is even there.

### **Why does the conflict persist to this day?**

This is a question I remember having when I was first learning about the Israel--Palestine conflict. Imagine we *did* forcibly remove everybody from Seattle. That would understandably upset people, but would their grandchildren still be going on about it 80 years later? How haven't people built new lives and moved past this by now? The people who were kicked out in 1947 aren't even alive anymore. The Israeli leadership who kicked them out aren't alive anymore. Is this not a thing of the past by now? We should be able to acknowledge that Israel is a country whose founding involved expelling people from territory, an action that would be unacceptable today. But so many other country's histories also contain bad things. American Indians aren't resorting to terrorism and attacking the United States demanding to get their whole continent back. What keeps this particular fire burning?

The problem is this conflict was always put on hold and delayed just long enough for somebody to fire another shot and start things up again. This has been primarily the 'fault' of the Arab side, who have refused, for decades, to accept compromise that involved Israel existing in any form. The initial crime of Israel expelling people from its territory apparently could not be forgiven, and being vocally anti-Zionist was a way to become popular in the Arab world. They would proclaim their commitment to the destruction of Israel, and by the 1970s Israel had become the main representative of a perceived alliance between Jews and Christians in a global war against Islam or the Islamic world. But even before that, things had quickly stopped being about Israel and Zionism and became about Jews as a people. They talked so badly about Jewish people they might have felt at home in Nazi Germany. Their express goals weren't restitution for the families that were expelled from the region; it was the destruction of the entirety of Israel and the murder of all Jewish people therewithin, from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. This isn't hyperbole---they proclaimed it explicitly.

In some sense, on some level, the reason the conflict still persists is the fact Israel is a Jewish rather than Muslim country. Why did all the Arab countries oppose the formation of Israel to begin with? Why did they reject the partition plan? Why have they rejected every attempt at compromise or partition since then? From the beginning, they hated the idea of Jewish people having political agency in a country where they get to be the majority instead of being ruled over by Muslims. This is also why the Muslim population opposes political autonomy for Christians, Zoroastrians, Yizidis, or any other non-Muslim religious group in the Middle East. Muslims want everything to be dominated by Islam. They would all be happy to live under another caliphate. For them, the fact that Jews historically mistreated a small number of Muslims by kicking them out of Palestine isn't a tragedy, but a happy coincidence. It plays into their narrative and gives them something to use against Israel over, and over, and over again.

The Arab world has a vast amount of resources at their disposal. They could help the Palestinians. They don't. They could also take in the entire population of Gaza and the West Bank to their own countries, if they had to, but they won't do that either. The reality is they don't care about these people. For decades, the reason the Israel--Palestine conflict has continued and couldn't be resolved was because the Palestinian population had become a pawn in the game being played by Arab leaders. They were used as a bludgeon against Israel, a thorn in Israel's side. The Arab leadership didn't *want* the problem to be solved, nor did they want people to be able to move on, so much as they wanted to destroy Israel, and they would prolong the suffering the Palestinian people if they thought it could help them accomplish that. The Palestinian population was meanwhile sold the lie that the rest of the Arab world stood with them, and that if they just keep fighting eventually they would win and take it all. Where has that got them?

In any given conflict, both sides could've done things differently. For the time and place, and given the stakes and situation, were there any major mistakes? It's hard to know for sure, because it's hard to know what would've happened instead if they didn't do the things they did.
