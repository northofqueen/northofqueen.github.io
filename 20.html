# **Israel notes** | 2025-02-13

### **Exposition**

Israel--Palestine feels like the most polarizing issue ever. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. How could you not support the only democracy in the Middle East and side with the antisemitic terrorists who rape innocents and use their own people as human shields? No, wait, how could you possibly support the fascist apartheid state that's trying to genocide Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out and having no opinion isn't a safe bet either. Silence in the face of oppression is siding with the oppressor.

I've watched this topic dismantle friendships. I'm willing to risk conflict over certain issues---ones where if someone disagrees with me, I'd rather they know, and possibly fuck off---but this one is so unimportant to me in the grand scheme of things, and so difficult to cut through people's emotions about, that it's generally not worth touching. It's safer to avoid the conversation. And I feel that was many other people's approach before the Hamas attack on 2023-Oct-07, which thrust the issue into our view and made having an opinion about it most fashionable. In the last couple years, it seems like popular sentiment has shifted against Israel, and Palestine flags have started showing up seemingly everywhere.

There's legitimate criticism of Israel's current actions, and there are some aspects of Israeli politics I find concerning to say the least (read: entitled religious nonsense). We should be making our support for Israel more conditional, making demands of them, drawing some red lines about what we're comfortable with them doing if they want to stay in our good graces. Their slow expansion into the West Bank seems plainly unjustified, their occupation of the Golan Heights should probably end, and---although it hasn't happened yet---I certainly wouldn't approve of Israel expanding into Gaza, should that happen in the future (that should probably be a red line drawn before it happens). In the worst light, Israel appears similar to Russia, as a country that is annexing territory from its neighbours simply because it can, and should be condemned similarly.

However, anti-Zionist hard-liners have shown me they're often black-and-white thinkers (if you don't want to destroy Israel, you support a genocide of Palestinians) who are extremely biased in their thinking (everything Israel does is viewed through the most critical lens possible, while there is endless charity, compassion, and excuses for the actions of their enemies) who play fast and loose with the facts (timelines, numbers, reliability of reporting, etc.) and language (everything Israel does is genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, fascism, etc.), which they're strongly attached to and insistent on (in order to control the framing of the conversation, they often refuse to proceed to talking about the issue if you don't agree with all the labels they apply to it). For these reasons, I've often found myself in contentious conversations where I'm stuck playing the part of 'Israel defender' simply because the person who is condemning Israel is going so unreasonably about it.

For the purpose of clarity in discourse, I've put together a list of claims that I would make or defend about the topic, some more anti-Israel and some more pro-Israel.

### **Why is this conflict so important?**

It's not callous to pick and choose what things get your attention. There is nobody who talks about every single conflict going on in the world. There are just too many of them. People are dying all over the place. How much attention do you pay to the deadly civil wars happening right now in Myanmar, Yemen, or Ethiopia? How about the drug wars happening between rival gangs in South America, or the thousands who died last year in a war in West Africa between splinters of ISIS and al-Qaeda? The most important conflict in the world right now, both in terms of casualties and of the geopolitical implications of its outcome, is the Russo-Ukraine war, and it's not even close. So the question is, what makes Israel--Palestine so significant? Why are there so many people who talk more about it than anything else?

I've known some people who care dearly about this conflict because they're from the Middle East or relatives who've been affected by it. That's fair. But why do so many random white people seem to make this conflict their number-one political issue? There are many factors.

- The conflict is alluring because it offers an **intersection of various ideological narratives** not present in other conflicts. It's not just a war, but one that invokes how we feel about imperialism, colonialism, racism, religious prejudice, etc.
- We're intrigued by **the connection between early Zionism and European history**. We learn in school about the Jews being victims of the Holocaust, then we learn in the aftermath they went to the Middle East and created Israel. If the war happening in Myanmar had a causal link to something that happened in France, it would be more likely to catch our interest, and we might feel responsible for what's happening there.
- We're aware of the conflict because **our politicians talk about it** and clarify the importance of supporting Israel, calling it our ally. If every election season our politicians felt the need to declare their support for Ecuador, then we might start caring more about whatever it is that's happening down there, because it's like, wait, what are we supporting exactly?
- It's **divisive**. If I was very passionate about my opposition to, let's say, the Taliban, and went out to protest with signs condemning them, everybody walking by would just be like, well, yeah? Who's defending the Taliban? There wouldn't be much of a conversation. The fact people disagree about Israel encourages us to keep talking about it.
- The conflict has been **packaged in a way that makes it feel morally uncomplicated** for some people, and therefore easy to take a stand on. This took rhetorical maneuvering to accomplish, because the conflict has been a messy, complicated back-and-forth between two sides killing each other in a way that has no clear answer and invokes a web of history and religious beliefs. That's why for most of my life, "peace in the Middle East" has been a punchline or a simile for a messy situation that's impossible to figure out---but since the Oct-7 attacks, oversimplified rhetoric about Israal has ramped up and convinced an increasingly large crowd of people that figuring out who's in the right is actually a very simple matter. Just say "genocide is bad". If they disagree, it's like, what are you, a genocide defender? The other side attempts a similar thing, except it's "terrorism is bad". What are you, a terrorist sympathizer?

Even though none of this is a measure of the consequences of the conflict for the rest of the world, we can still understand why it's come into our view and has remained so consistently.

### **Competing intuitions**

Imagine you know nothing about Israel--Palestine. You've never heard about it before, you have no bias, you haven't been influenced to think one way or another. If you started examining the conflict right now, or perhaps at a point in time 3 years ago, what would be your initial impression?

It depends. The conflict invites different intuitions depending on who's asking. Here are some possibilities:

- **Choose the side that's less bad.** This is how many people who end up being more pro-Israel operate. If there's a war between two sides and we have to choose which to support, a good way to start is to ask which side is less immoral. There are many ways in which Israel come across as less bad than groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. They have a better system of government, they have better laws, they're better on women's rights, they commit fewer atrocities and war crimes, until 2014 they were the only country in the region where homosexuality wasn't illegal. If a normal person looks at Tel Aviv and then at cities in other countries in the region, they might pretty quickly decide what side they want to be on.
- **Choose the side that's on our side.** If one country is burning American flags and chanting death to America, while the other side is reaching out and saying they're willing to work with us, then maybe we should just pick the latter. Why make it more complicated? Israel is, apparently, a good ally to the United States. They do good intelligence work, they have a good tech industry. They provide us a good foothold in the Middle East. Prior to trying to examine the conflict itself, a person might just decide supporting Israel seems like the rational choice.
- **With great power comes great responsibility**, or, **a tendency to favour the underdog**. If one side of a conflict is far more powerful and wealthy than the other, they're the ones who are really in control and they should ergo be held to a higher standard, and we should be examining the conflict primarily from their perspective. They're holding all the cards. We should also be careful about how much blame we put on people who are oppressed, because they have fewer options, be more desperate, and in cases where an unfair situation goes on for more than a generation, you'll have people being born into this conflict who know no other life, so they lack our modern perspective to guide their own actions. They have agency, but perhaps less culpability.
- **Anti-imperialism** or **nativist bias**. This is more common among the far-left than moderates, but some people look at the conflict and they see Israel as the more foreign country whose population are outsiders to the region, whereas the Palestinians are the people who were there first. This means even before any fighting occurs, if both groups claim a right to the same land, there is more legitimacy to the Palestinian claim, and ergo Palestinians are more justified in the ensuing conflict. Israel's very existence is moreover seen as part of or an extension of a broader Western colonial project, which further casts it in a negative light. There is a lingering feeling of injustice that comes from the feeling that Israel is itself built on stolen property.
- **Be sensitive to our own prejudice**. We all have some bias or another, and some---racism, sexism, xenophobia---can affect how people judge a conflict between parties of different groups. Liberal people try to be aware of common prejudice and compensate for them in our evaluation of things. Not all prejudice is conscious and deliberate, but combatting prejudice generally has to be. If a fight happens at work between a man and woman in a way that seems to make others bias toward the man, we might stop and give extra consideration to the woman's point of view to ensure we're not overlooking her perspective out of sexism (even if a passive, 'accidental' sexism). Would we feel the same way about what happened if their roles were reversed but their actions weren't? If so, why? This kind of self-checking and reflection can be valuable.
If you apply this to Israel--Palestine, there are some ways in which there's a danger of being biased toward Israel: Israeli is more similar to our society, they're more 'Western', many Americans are prejudiced against Muslims, we also tend to like wealthier people over poorer people, and Israelis are generally thought of or depicted as being more racially 'white' than the Arabs (this isn't really true---many Israelis are 'non-white'---but it's still part of how many people conceptualize the conflict). So automatically, we should place a higher level of scrutiny on the Israelis, to compensate for the ways in which we might just be being prejudiced against the other side.

### **Israel has a compelling, heroic narrative**

The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority group, victims of one of the most terrible genocides ever, a group the most powerful Western countries didn't care about even after having just liberated them from the Nazis. What are they to do? They came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy instead of being forever at the mercy of the ruling majority population of other countries. Predictably they were attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies who would prefer to wipe them all out.

Today the 'underdog' mentality benefits the Palestinians, but in the past it more benefited Israel. Look at them on a map, surrounded by much larger enemies who are more numerous in number. And Israel didn't used to have the technological or economic advantages it has today. For decades Israel was the underdog in the Middle East, and much of that time was spent during the Cold War, when the entire world was fighting over democracy versus Communism. They were on our side, the only democracy in the Middle East. Their victories felt like our victories. That's how people alive today who remember those years largely feel about it. They went to war against Hezbollah and Hamas, and they came out ahead, and then we took down the Berlin Wall. It all blurs together in the collective memory as a time that it kicked ass to be American.

Then 9/11 happened and that firmly secured that in the fight between Jews and Muslims, the Muslims are the ones who aren't on our side, meaning the Jews are the ones who are, because the enemy of my enemy and all that. But if you were born in the late 90s or later, you might barely remember 9/11, not remember the Cold War at all, and none of this really means anything to you. For you, Israel is just some country somewhere that all your politicians weirdly feel the need to mention, and then you hear on the news that they're doing apartheid and racism and ethnic cleansing, and you're like, hey, isn't all that stuff bad?

### **The history of the conflict**

I'm not an historian. I haven't spent years thoroughly researching this. I'm just doing my best to try and understand the basic timeline of events that led to where we are today, and I'm going to share the understanding that I've come away with.

Even before the rise of Nazi Germany, Jews were not treated well in much of Europe. **Theodor Herzl** (1860--1904) is considered to have been the Jew who founded modern Zionism by talking about how Jews should all come together and make a country. The case that Jews ought to do this---because they can't trust the Christian countries of Europe to treat them well---would only get stronger over time, and these ideas became all the more potent after his death.

As a consequence of the events of World War I (1914--1918), the **Ottoman Empire**, which controlled this whole part of the Middle East from Greece to Egypt to Mecca, collapsed. The British and Ottomans were on opposing sides, and Britain helped Saudi Arabia lead an Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916. The following year, with WWI still ongoing, British foreign secretary Balfour declared that Britain would support its Jewish community in trying to establish a national home for their people in the Ottoman region of Palestine, where there was already a small Jewish population. His letter of support to the is now known as Balfour Declaration.

After the war ended, the Ottoman territory along the Red Sea was taken over by Saudi Arabia, and the Levant was taken over by the British and French, who agreed in 1916, a couple years prior, to partition it horizontally, with Britain taking the southern part and France the North (this was called the Sykes--Picot Agreement). Palestine was the region on the westernmost part of the British side of the partition, so it was the British whom the Jews had to work with to control the area.

The problem is Britain had made an overlapping agreement with Arab leaders.

Even before Nazi Germany, Jews were not treated well in Europe. This led to some Jews wanting to unite to pursue political independence.



- The way Israelis tried to establish their state in the beginning wasn't so bad. People talk about it like it was terrible, and at first I just assumed it was as well, but the more I learned about it, the more I thought, eh, not really, like at worst it was mildly bad.
    - The land was just random imperial territory, they pursued diplomacy with the leading empires, they got Britain to commit in the 20s to giving them a section of land, and they purchased a bunch more. Jews moved into areas that were almost completely undeveloped and started building their own communities from nothing.
    - The way people retell this now makes it sound like there used to be a sprawling country called Palestine until Jews showed up one day and stole half of it, but there wasn't a country there, it was mostly empty land, with some sparse villages, like the population of one small city stretched out across the whole region, including many Jews. The early Israelis then agreed to settlement deals that would have split the area between the two populations. They didn't insist on maintaining everything they started with. If everything had gone according to that original plan, it wouldn't have really stood out in history as that bad an event.
    - To our modern sensibilities, it does seem unfortunate that people were forcibly displaced from the region after the 1947 war ("the nakba"), though this is something everybody opposed a lot less in the past. There were forced relocations happening in Europe that same decade, so this didn't really stand out as a unique evil in the world, especially since it wasn't about race or extermination; it was about pushing out a small population of people who wanted you and everybody you knew dead. They violently and uncompromisingly opposed a Jewish community being autonomous in any form, part of a broader pattern in the Middle East, which is what Muslims try to prevent any non-Muslim population from having political power.
    - It obviously sucks for the people affected by it, though. There were inevitably some random families ejected who were more or less innocent. Not so badly that I'd expect there to still be conflict raging about the displacement 70 years later, but still, I get why the people affected were pissed off and walked away just thinking Israel had fucked them over.
- The reason things went so badly in the 40s, and the reason it turned into war and expulsions, was basically the same reason all the proposed peace deals and partitions since then have failed as well, which is the Arab side only wants to fight, they accept no deal or compromise, they just want every single Jew gone and Israel destroyed.
- Israel by comparison has been very compromising, accepting partitions and being willing to give up territory. To this very day, their actions---blockading and later going to war with Gaza, maintaining a military presence in the West Bank and the Golan Heights---continues to be largely self-defensive in terms of motivation. I don't believe they would insist on these operations if those areas weren't chaotic, quasi-stateless power-vacuums full of people who are ideologically locked in to waging war against Israel at all cost. The latest couple generations of Palestinians are people born into hardship, raised being told that Jews are the enemy and that Allah wants you to wipe them off the way. They're radicalized young. If Israel just fucks off and sits on their hands, the result isn't peace, it's these places collapse back into being ruled by terrorists, who, as soon as they can, start planning the next Oct-7.
