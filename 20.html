# Israel notes

These days I talk to most left-leaning people than right-leaning, meaning I'm more likely to talk with people who lean being anti-Israel, which is seemingly one of the biggest, most divisive topics of all.

I don't think I'm very pro-Israel. I'm rather moderate on the issue. There is legitimate criticism of the country's current actions, and there are some aspects of Israel politics I find concerning. I also feel the West should be making our support for Israel more conditional, making some demands of them, drawing some red lines about what we're comfortable with them doing. The slow territorial expansion in the West Bank seems plainly unjustified, the occupation of the Golan heights should probably end (I'm not the most knowledgeable of that situation, but my intuition is that it's not justified either), and although it hasn't happened yet, I certainly wouldn't approve of Israel expanding into Gaza, should that ever happen in the future.

However, my experience with anti-Zionist hardliners has shown me they're often black-and-white thinkers (you either want to destroy Israel, or you support genociding Arabs) who are extremely biased in their thinking (everything Israel does is viewed in the most critical light possible, while we shrug off all the uncompromising violence and extremism of their enemies) and who play fast and loose with the facts and with their language (everything Israel does is genocide apartheid ethnic cleansing fascism etc.), which they're very attached to and insistent on (in order to control the framing of the conversation). I there end up in contentious conversations where I'm stuck playing the part of 'Israel defender', despite the fact that, as I've said, I don't really think I'm *that* much in favour of them.

This is a list of claims that I would make or defend about the topic which go in the more pro-Israel direction, for if you're one of the people who wants to argue with me about this.

- **Israel as a country does have a compelling, heroic narrative.** I feel like this should be agreeable even to people who hate what the country has become, but often people push back when I say this. Take a minute and try to appreciate what I mean. A powerless, persecuted minority group---victims of one of the most terrible genocides ever---a group that the most powerful Western countries *still* didn't care about despite having just liberated them from the Nazis---came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance to create their own space where they could be safe and they could have autonomy instead of forever being at the mercy of the majority populations in other countries. They were predictably attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves in their historical homeland, despite being surrounded on all sides by extremist lunatics who want to murder every single one of them. It makes sense that so many Westerners ended up feeling like we're on Israel's side.
- The way Israelis tried to establish their state in the beginning wasn't bad. People talk about it like it was terrible, and at first I just assumed it was as well, but the more I learned about it, the more I thought, eh, not really, like at worst it was mildly bad.
 - The land was just random imperial territory, they pursued diplomacy with the leading empires, they got Britain to commit in the 20s to giving them a section of land, and they purchased a bunch more. Jews moved into areas that were almost completely undeveloped and started building their own communities from nothing.
 - The way people retell this now makes it sound like there used to be a sprawling country called Palestine until Jews showed up one day and stole half of it, but there wasn't a country there, it was mostly empty land, with some sparse villages, like the population of one small city stretched out across the whole region, including many Jews. The early Israelis then agreed to settlement deals that would have split the area between the two populations. They didn't insist on maintaining everything they started with. If everything had gone according to that original plan, it wouldn't have really stood out in history as that bad an event.
 - To our modern sensibilities, it does seem unfortunate that people were forcibly displaced from the region after the 1947 war ("the nakba"), though this is something everybody opposed a lot less in the past. There were forced relocations happening in Europe that same decade, so this didn't really stand out as a unique evil in the world, especially since it wasn't about race or extermination; it was about pushing out a small population of people who wanted you and everybody you knew dead. They violently and uncompromisingly opposed a Jewish community being autonomous in any form, part of a broader pattern in the Middle East, which is what Muslims try to prevent any non-Muslim population from having political power.
 - It obviously sucks for the people affected by it, though. There were inevitably some random families ejected who were more or less innocent. Not so badly that I'd expect there to still be conflict raging about the displacement 70 years later, but still, I get why the people affected were pissed off and walked away just thinking Israel had fucked them over.
- The reason things went so badly in the 40s, and the reason it turned into war and expulsions, was basically the same reason all the proposed peace deals and partitions since then have failed as well, which is the Arab side only wants to fight, they accept no deal or compromise, they just want every single Jew gone and Israel destroyed.
- Israel by comparison has been very compromising, accepting partitions and being willing to give up territory. To this very day, their actions---blockading and later going to war with Gaza, maintaining a military presence in the West Bank and the Golan Heights---continues to be largely self-defensive in terms of motivation. I don't believe they would insist on these operations if those areas weren't chaotic, quasi-stateless power-vacuums full of people who are ideologically locked in to waging war against Israel at all cost. The latest couple generations of Palestinians are people born into hardship, raised being told that Jews are the enemy and that Allah wants you to wipe them off the way. They're radicalized young. If Israel just fucks off and sits on their hands, the result isn't peace, it's these places collapse back into being ruled by terrorists, who, as soon as they can, start planning the next Oct-7.
