# **Israel notes** | 2025-02-13

Israel--Palestine feels like the most polarizing issue ever. It's one where people feel you can't just agree to disagree; you're either on their side or you're a bad person. How could you not support the only democracy in the Middle East and side with the antisemitic terrorists who rape innocents and use their own people as human shields? No, wait, how could you possibly support the fascist apartheid state that's trying to genocide Palestinians for their colonialist project? And no, sitting this one out and having no opinion isn't a safe bet either. I've watched this topic divide my friends. It gets weirdly heated and personal for something that has no effect on us happening so far from home. I've been speaking with more left-leaning people than right-leaning people these days, and some of them have taken issue with me for seeming too pro-Israel, though I think they have warped standards and in reality I'm just normal and moderate about it.

There's plenty of legitimacy criticism of Israel's current actions, and there are some aspects of Israeli politics I find concerning to say the least. I also feel the West should be making our support for Israel more conditional, making demands of them, drawing some red lines about what we're comfortable with them doing if they want to stay in our good graces. The slow expansion into the West Bank seems plainly unjustified to me, their occupation of the Golan Heights should probably end (less sure), and although it hasn't happened yet, I certainly wouldn't approve of Israel expanding into Gaza, should that happen in the future (that should probably be a red line drawn before it happens). In the worst light, Israel appears similar to Russia, as a country that is annexing territory from its neighbours simply because it can, and should be condemned similarly.

However, anti-Zionist hard-liners have shown me they're often black-and-white thinkers (you must want to destroy Israel or you support a genocide of Arabs) who are extremely biased in their thinking (every Israel does is viewed through the most critical lens possible, while we have endless understanding and compassion for their enemies) who play fast and loose with the facts and language (everything Israel does is genocide, aparthheid, ethnic cleansing, fascism, etc.), which they're attached to and insistent on (in order to control the framing of the conversation, they often refuse to proceed to talking about the issue if you don't agree with all the labels they apply to it). For these reasons, I've often found myself in contentious conversations where I'm stuck playing the part of 'Israel defender' simply because the person who is condemning Israel is going so unreasonably about it.

For the purpose of clarity in discourse, I've put together a list of claims that I would make or defend about the topic, some more anti-Israel and some more pro-Israel.

### **This conflict's importance is overstated**

There are many conflicts happening across the world at any one time. For people who are living directly in the region where conflict is occurring, the outcome of said conflict is important, but what impact its resolution will have on the rest of the world varies. The conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia probably doesn't really matter to anybody who's not Ethiopian or Somalian, for instance. And who outside of the region involved cares about the outcome of the Guyana--Venezuela dispute? By contrast, some conflicts do have a broader global importance. The Russia--Ukraine war and any potential conflict between China and Taiwan are both examples of this. Regardless of where you're from, you should care about what precedent ends up being set for international politics by these issues.





Israel--Palestine is not. Which side is going to end up winning, Israel or Hamas and Hezbollah?




### **Israel has a compelling, heroic narrative**

Let's start here, with something that seems comparatively trivial. I'm surprised people who hate what Israel has *become* can't agree to even this. Take a moment to appreciate what I mean. The Jews were a powerless, persecuted minority, victims of one of the most terrible genocides ever, a group which the most powerful Western countries still didn't care about despite having just liberated them from Nazis. They came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance to create their own space where they could be safe and have autonomy, instead of forever being at the mercy of the majority populations of other countries. They were predictably attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves despite being surrounded by enemies on all side who want to murder every single one of them.

I feel like this should be agreeable even to people who hate what the country has become, but often people push back when I say this. Take a minute and try to appreciate what I mean. A powerless, persecuted minority group---victims of one of the most terrible genocides ever---a group that the most powerful Western countries *still* didn't care about despite having just liberated them from the Nazis---came to the conclusion they had to come together in solidarity and resistance to create their own space where they could be safe and they could have autonomy instead of forever being at the mercy of the majority populations in other countries. They were predictably attacked, but they persevered, fought, and won, carving out a home for theirselves in their historical homeland, despite being surrounded on all sides by extremist lunatics who want to murder every single one of them. It makes sense that so many Westerners ended up feeling like we're on Israel's side.

- The way Israelis tried to establish their state in the beginning wasn't so bad. People talk about it like it was terrible, and at first I just assumed it was as well, but the more I learned about it, the more I thought, eh, not really, like at worst it was mildly bad.
    - The land was just random imperial territory, they pursued diplomacy with the leading empires, they got Britain to commit in the 20s to giving them a section of land, and they purchased a bunch more. Jews moved into areas that were almost completely undeveloped and started building their own communities from nothing.
    - The way people retell this now makes it sound like there used to be a sprawling country called Palestine until Jews showed up one day and stole half of it, but there wasn't a country there, it was mostly empty land, with some sparse villages, like the population of one small city stretched out across the whole region, including many Jews. The early Israelis then agreed to settlement deals that would have split the area between the two populations. They didn't insist on maintaining everything they started with. If everything had gone according to that original plan, it wouldn't have really stood out in history as that bad an event.
    - To our modern sensibilities, it does seem unfortunate that people were forcibly displaced from the region after the 1947 war ("the nakba"), though this is something everybody opposed a lot less in the past. There were forced relocations happening in Europe that same decade, so this didn't really stand out as a unique evil in the world, especially since it wasn't about race or extermination; it was about pushing out a small population of people who wanted you and everybody you knew dead. They violently and uncompromisingly opposed a Jewish community being autonomous in any form, part of a broader pattern in the Middle East, which is what Muslims try to prevent any non-Muslim population from having political power.
    - It obviously sucks for the people affected by it, though. There were inevitably some random families ejected who were more or less innocent. Not so badly that I'd expect there to still be conflict raging about the displacement 70 years later, but still, I get why the people affected were pissed off and walked away just thinking Israel had fucked them over.
- The reason things went so badly in the 40s, and the reason it turned into war and expulsions, was basically the same reason all the proposed peace deals and partitions since then have failed as well, which is the Arab side only wants to fight, they accept no deal or compromise, they just want every single Jew gone and Israel destroyed.
- Israel by comparison has been very compromising, accepting partitions and being willing to give up territory. To this very day, their actions---blockading and later going to war with Gaza, maintaining a military presence in the West Bank and the Golan Heights---continues to be largely self-defensive in terms of motivation. I don't believe they would insist on these operations if those areas weren't chaotic, quasi-stateless power-vacuums full of people who are ideologically locked in to waging war against Israel at all cost. The latest couple generations of Palestinians are people born into hardship, raised being told that Jews are the enemy and that Allah wants you to wipe them off the way. They're radicalized young. If Israel just fucks off and sits on their hands, the result isn't peace, it's these places collapse back into being ruled by terrorists, who, as soon as they can, start planning the next Oct-7.
