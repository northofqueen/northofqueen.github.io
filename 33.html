# The Lorax sux |2025-02-27

Look, I know, it's just a cartoon. I watched it when I was a kid too. And it has a reasonable message. It's on the side of good, in a way. But real talk, I fucking hate the original Lorax. It's like pure dishonest propaganda, shamelessly aimed at kids, trying to make them feel guilty for like, cutting down trees? It's bad tactics (bad as in wrong, not bad as in not effective) for a good cause.

The message isn't "sustainable farming is good". Instead it portrays a world where sustainable farming apparently doesn't exist at all. The only person in the world is a businessman who's an evil moron who's somehow oblivious to the fact he's destroying everything in a way that will quickly become unsustainable.

And where does it all go? We cut down these trees and turn them into one of the most amazing products ever. Exceptional utility. But there are no customers. There are no people whose lives are improved by these factories. Instead all work is automated and the products are just shifted over the horizon. There must be *someone* who buys all the things the Onceler produces, but we never see any of them. We briefly see 'workers', but they're actually just hands coming out of nowhere. No faces, no families, no homes or games or personalities. It's all completely abstract. We're shown all of the downside, none of the upside.

We should see the thneed (the imaginary product the Once-ler's company makes) being purchased and brought into people's homes where you see how having these things actually improves people's lives and there's a reason they keep buying them. The conflict is that although it gave us great benefit, it came at a great cost, and we had to be aware of the effects of our actions and find balance in the way that we run things. Some kind of solution should be presented that's not just "never harvest things from nature again, you evil greedy human". The story ends with the world seemingly completely destroyed and this kid being told he needs to rebuild. Well, I mean, it begins that way, and then the whole story is the kid being told a story. But you get me.

I went through a phase when I was a teenager where I really considered whether environmentalism was all an exaggerated anti-human farce because I reflected on how bullshit things like the Lorax were. If you want to make art that has a message, please do it properly. Don't be like the Lorax.
