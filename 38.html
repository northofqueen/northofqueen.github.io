# Pierre Poilievre | 2025-03-13

I dislike the direction the Conservative Party has gone recently. I dislike their leader, Pierre Poilievre (pawl-ee-ev). He may be an effective demagogue and media strategist, but he is not what Canada should be looking for in a leader. Here I'll explore some examples of his conduct to give you a sense of why this is my opinion.

### The passport kerfuffle

The Canadian passport, like most country's passports, is periodically updated to add security features and change its design, as happened again in 2023. As a personal note, I didn't love the redesign---each version has various faded images in the background of the pages, and the previous version had depictions of significant things from Canadian history, whereas [the 2023 design has more contemporary, nature-focused imagery](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-new-passport-more-nature-fewer-history-1.6838308) of people skiing, leaves, snowflakes, and wildlife. I looked over a number of comparisons, and I preferred the previous one. But is it a big deal? No. It is so much not a big deal that it's comical we're still talking about it.

The passport redesign has nothing to do with the Prime Minister, it doesn't require the PM's approval, and everybody knows this, including our Opposition Leader. Speaking in May 2023, Sean Fraser, then-Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said the new design was "the result of 10 years of consultation" suggesting people liked celebrating Canada's natural environment. Among the images used in the previous passport that were not featured in the newest version was a depiction of the Vimy Ridge Memorial. The Royal Canadian Legion, our largest veterans' support organization, said they were sad to see it removed.

Thoughts or criticism about the design change are one thing. How Mr. Poilievre thought it was appropriate to deliver these comments to the press is so beyond me that I must think he knew it was inappropriate and proceeded anyway:

||indent
The current prime minister's woke and out-of-touch ideology is so egotistical that he cannot imagine there are any Canadian stories bigger than him. ... That is why he deletes Terry Fox, the soldiers who died at Vimy, the City of Quebec, and the RCMP from our passport to replace it with a colouring book that includes an image of him swimming at Harrington Lake when he was a boy.
Why is he deleting the 3'598 Canadians who gave their lives so that Canada could have freedom and victory at Vimy? He is erasing them and with that, he is insulting all of our veterans.
--- Pierre Poilievre

Then, separately:

||indent
Justin Trudeau wants to cancel our proud history, erasing it from our passports. Our great military triumphs, gone. The [famous five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five_(Canada\)), who secured women's rights, gone. Even Terry Fox had to go. **Why? Because there can be no heroes but him.** So he replaced these images in our passport with an image of himself swimming as a boy at Harrington Lake, and pictures of snowflakes, in honour of members of his Liberal cabinet.
This business of deleting our past must end. And this is a matter on which English Canada must start to learn from Quebec. Quebeccers, and I'm saying this deliberately in English, do not apologize for their culture, their language, and their history. They celebrate it. And all Canadidans should do the same.
--- Pierre Poilievre[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udjqw5YuzKI)

This reminds me of when the American president [blamed Trudeau](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/26/politics/home-alone-trump-justin-trudeau/index.html) for the CBC cutting his brief cameo from a daytime airing of Home Alone 2. At least some people argued that was a joke, because there's always plausible deniability in those circles. Poilievre was not joking.

These statements, if made by a random person, would be mundanely stupid---the ramblings of somebody who feels anger at the government, despite having little knowledge of how anything works, but who wants to channel it *somewhere*. For a party leader who hopes to be Prime Minister, this is ridiculous and embarrassing, not only because it's a lie.

Poilievre is well aware that it makes no sense to blame any of his complaints about the passport design on Trudeau, but he does not care and continues with his attacks nonetheless, likely for no reason beyond that it plays well with his audience. Even if Trudeau had been personally in charge of every aspect of the new passport, to say that he is egotistical and is trying to 'delete' our history by no longer having it in the background of the pages of our passport would still be idiotic---and though Trudeau is *not* to blame, the implication is still that this insulting description may be applied to whoever was behind the redesign.

There was not a depiction of Justin Trudeau in the new passport. It's unfortunate that I even need to say this. There was a picture of some boy and some water, and Poilievre made up that it's supposed to be Trudeau and that it's supposed to be Harrington Lake, just like he made up the idea that Trudeau had anything to do with the passport redesign in general.

The casual dishonesty, speculative personal insults, and divisive, incendiary phrasing meant to falsely imply that our head of government wants to erase our history and make us apologize for our culture---this is all unbecoming of somebody who wants to represent us.

### The CBC and Twitter

In 2023, Twitter started labelling organizations like RussiaToday and the Chinese state-run television CGTN as "state-affiliated media". This was to indicate their bias and agenda for readers, because these aren't independent journalists; they are mouthpieces for the Russian and Chinese regimes. Twitter later also labelled Western publicly-funded outlets like NPR and the CBC as "government-funded media". Many felt this was misleading, albeit technically true---these organizations don't take any editorial direction from their governments, and as such their content doesn't have the same sort of bias that readers need to be warned about. Labelling them in this way could send the wrong message to readers. It was later also noted that Twitter's own policy defined the label as being for agencies whose content direction may have varying degrees of government involvement, which these companies denied. The CBC [wrote on their twitter account at the time](https://x.com/CBCRadioCanada/status/1648033861152960531) that their "journalism is impartial and independent. To suggest otherwise is untrue", and said they would stop using Twitter entirely as a result of the label.

Twitter later [removed the labels](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/twitter-changes-tags-1.6817729), but not before Poilievre noticed and celebrated. The Conservative Party, like other right-wing parties these days, would be happy to get rid of public utilities like the CBC and have society rely entirely on right-wing alt-media on the internet instead. Poilievre [wrote, also on Twitter, that](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1647750040142876674) the CBC had been "officially exposed as 'government-funded media'" and that "now people know it is Trudeau propaganda, not news."

What on Earth is Poilievre meaning when he says it was "exposed"? As though anything new had been revealed? We all know the CBC is a Crown Corporation that receives public funding. Why is Poilievre acting as though Twitter has taught us anything? And the implication of his phrasing is that it revealed something damning. It hadn't.

The description "Trudeau propaganda, not news" is even more absurd. Trudeau has no direction over the CBC. Poilievre is implicitly telling the public that the CBC is not an independent agency nor even "news" but that it's state propaganda akin to RussiaToday---all of which he knows very well is false. Unless the intended meaning is only that it's Trudeau propaganda as in it's propaganda *for* Trudeau, not by him. But how is slanted news, or news from a biased organization, not news at all? There's no way to make this make sense. How can a person say with a straight face that the CBC is just propaganda, not news?

Poilievre also takes the opportunity to link to a petition to defund the CBC.

### Poilievre the showman

Poilievre, [speaking in the House in April 2024, asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulI_n-NqcI): "When will we put an end to this wacko policy by this wacko prime minister?" Speaker of the House, Greg Fergus, stood and said this was not acceptable and asked the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw his unparliamentary language. For anybody not Canadian who's unfamiliar, the Speaker is the presiding officer of a session of Parliament, and he or she has broad authority in that role to preside over debate, facilitate the asking and answering of questions, and maintain general order and decorum of the House. The authority of the Speaker is not something that you question in the middle of a session of Parliament---unless you *want* to get thrown out. It's like a hockey player trying to assault the ref.

||transcript
Speaker Fergus | "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to withdraw that term, which is not considered parliamentary."
Mr. Poilievre | "Mr. Speaker, I replace wacko with extremist. He is an extremist."
Speaker Fergus | "I'm going to ask the leader of the opposition once again to just withdraw that comment, please. And I'll invite the honourable member to... I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition to please withdraw that comment, and simply withdraw that comment."
Mr. Poilievre | "I'll replace it with radical. That's his policy."
Speaker Fergus | "I am not asking to replace. I am asking the honourable member to just simply withdraw."
Mr. Poilievre | "Mr. Speaker, I replace the word wacko with extremist."
Speaker Fergus | "I'm going to ask the honourable leader of the opposition one last time to please withdraw that comment, and *simply* withdraw that comment."
Mr. Poilievre | "I simply withdraw and replace with the aforementioned adjective."
Speaker Fergus | "Mr. Poilievre, I have to name you for disregarding the authority of the chair, pursuant to the authority granted to me by standing order 11, I order you to withdraw from the House and from any participation by video conference for the remainder of this day's sitting."

Poilievre is not uninformed about how Parliament works. This was deliberately obstinate, an attempt by the Conservative Party to push the envelope and wear away at our norms of civility, or---if anyone tried to stop them---to play the victim and make a big fuss about the Speaker finally being forced to remove them for their pointless lack of coöperation.

"Wacko" is not even the worst of what Poilievre has called Trudeau and other Liberal members. His language has been increasingly extreme and insulting, to a degree very much outside of the norm for Canadian politics, and certainly beyond anything that Trudeau says about him, or any of his other political opponents---publicly calling Trudeau an **extremist**, a **radical**, and [in at least one instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4nhifpVftA) he even called him a **Marxist** (all things Trudeau definitely is not); as well as simply making personal insults, calling him **weak**, an **embarrassment**, and a **narcissist**. There is no equivalent by the Liberals against Mr. Poilievre.

In addition to being incorrect to the point of being silly, this is not becoming of a national leader, even if he is the Opposition Leader. It would be lightly amusing if he were some nobody with a podcast, or an idiot who shouldn't be expected to know better. But this isn't the United States---I don't approve at all of this kind of disrespectful conduct. Poilievre is, perhaps more so now than anybody else in Canadian politics, bringing down the quality of our political culture.

### Woke this, woke that

Is anyone else sick of the term 'woke' yet? No, of course they are---I should be asking if you're sick of people asking you if you're sick of the term 'woke' yet, since I'm not the first person to use the line.

Whatever it may have originally meant, 'woke' has morphed into the perfect tool of propaganda in our new "attention economy". It allows people to channel many feelings for little substance. It's a way of "saying something" without really saying much of anything. The term's rhetorical power is, precisely, its ambiguity. It allows the listener to cast onto it whatever objectionable thing or behaviour *they* have in *their* mind. As such, heavy use of the term is a red flag---not a guarantee, but a warning---that you're listening to a charlatan.

What does it mean for something to be woke? If I say racism is bad, am I being woke? I don't know. Maybe. And that's the magic of it, really. And it's a resource that Poilievre is willing and happy to tap into. He criticized the government's military policy---ambiguously, without really identifying *what* he was criticizing---by saying "this insane woke DEI obsession is driving people away; nobody wants to be part of this woke social-engineering project." Woke, woke, woke.

He once argued against a law, speaking in the House of Commons, by saying "It gives the power to a woke agency, the CRTC"[](https://openparliament.ca/debates/2023/3/30/pierre-poilievre-2/) (the Canadian Radio-Television Telecomm Commission). The CRTT is woke? Why?

"I will end that radical woke ideology," he says. Okay. His next sentence: "I will treat every single Canadian equally." Wait, is that woke? "We will cut off the funds that have gone to antisemitic groups and to other hatemongers." Wait, are we defunding things for being racist? Isn't that woke? No, wait, are the antisemitic groups woke? Is it woke to be racist to Jews? What's going on?

I don't know how to determine whether or not a given thing will be called woke by the right-wing parties, if not for asking whether they happen to disagree with the outcomes at that point in time. It's impossible to nail it down to any concrete meaning in practice.

"The first thing I will do when I am Prime Minister is to bring back a warrior culture, not a woke culture. And we will be recruiting warriors to fight for this country again."[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlcuS5nwSi4)

Poilievre sounds like the governor of Florida, not somebody who wants to govern Canada.

### Other notes

A few other notes.

- Poilievre said he would not only oppose but strictly ban any members of his cabinet from participating in the World Economic Forum. That seems fairly stupid, and kind of leaning into conspiracy theories about the WEF, which I really dislike.
- He supports our legalization of marijuana, but opposes decriminalizing harder drugs. That's a reasonable policy stance. I probably agree, though I think many Liberals do as well.
- While some elements of the Conservative Party have been flirting with "anti-gender" sentiment from the US, Poilievre has mostly stayed away from it, except when reporters try and get him to talk about it. There was a moment where, in response to a question about whether trans women should be able to use female facilities, he essentially said no, and those should only be for females, not biological males. That's a little disappointing, and I think not aligned with the values of most Canadians---but even if this is something he personally feels, it's not something he's been vocal about at all, outside of that one comment, and he's been in government for over a decade, and he acknowledges that policy about women's facilities like washrooms is not at all in the purview of the federal government.
- Earlier this year, when the Trump admin. signed an executive order declaring there's only two genders, [Poilievre was asked what his feelings were about that, and said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwfC9z4YWhs ): "Well, I don't know. Do you have any other genders that you'd like to name? ... I'm not aware of any other genders than men and women, and I mean.. if you have any other you want me to consider, you're welcome to tell me. ... I'm only aware of two. ... As far as I'm concerned, we should have a government that just minds its own damn business and just leaves people alone to make their own personal decisions. That's the kind of government I'm going to run." This was perfectly reasonable.
- Poilievre would get thrown out of the Republican Party if he were to go to the United States. The particular blend of positions he holds would only work in Canada. He's pro-abortion, he defends our healthcare system. I don't think he wants to bring gun rights here, though he's not in favour of the government *increasing* restrictions on gun ownership from where we already are. He wants to stop guns being smuggled into the country. He takes reasonable positions on many domestic policy issues. He's not an extremist or radical. I would not characterize him as far-right. He is, in most ways, in terms of his opinions, positions, or proposals, a good representation of, or a good voice for, the right wing of Canada.
- Poilievre's response to Trump randomly deciding to attack Canada verbally, threaten us, our border, our waters, and impose tariffs against us, has not been perfect. I feel saying that you're going to be "Canada first" isn't the right note, but at the same time, his response hasn't been terrible. I think before this all happened, I would've been afraid that his response would turn out worse than it has been. I'm glad that our Conservative Party politicians---looking at Doug Ford, of course---haven't totally let me down. Poilievre advocated for retaliatory tariffs, to encourage intra-Canadian trade, and told Trump to fuck off, and strongly said Canada doesn't want to be part of Canada. That's good. That's basically what's required of him, plus a bit more.
- There has been a controversy about him not receiving security clearance to be able to help combat foreign interference in Canadian politics---but Poilievre says that he wants the information to be released publicly, and he believes that if he's made privy to classified information, this will be used against him somehow, because then he won't be able to criticize the government as publicly. I honestly don't know enough about how that works to comment further. Trudeau recently helped make a campaign ad [criticizing Poilievre for precisely this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvVDFdvaO3Y)
- I'm very glad that Poilievre has been consistently and clearly pro-Ukraine. I believe that the Russia--Ukraine war is the most important conflict in the world at this moment. It's the most important question for any politician who wants to be involved in international politics. Poilievre has not fallen into the trap, like some other right-wing politicians, of siding with Putin, nor even of questioning why we should care.
- A major problem with Poilievre is simply an extension of the Conservative Party in general: he seems to care not at all about the environment. Anything that helps the environment is going to have a negative effect on the oil and gas sector in the Canadian economy, and it's going to ripple all throughout the economy in the form of higher energy prices. Poilievre is committed to talking about the high cost of living, the high cost of groceries, of gas. For his purposes, carbon taxes are simply bad. But this is not a Poilievre problem. It's a Conservative Party problem. At least, however, the Conservative Party does not deny climate change in the way that right-wing parties in other countries do. They don't call it a scam. They just say it costs too much. — I have a nuanced opinion on carbon taxes. The environment is very important in the grand scheme of things, but Canada going above and beyond what is necessary for international agreements that curb the emissions of other, much larger countries, feels like it's going have no impact on the environment at all, while squeezing a population that's already dealing with economic issues. So if I were in charge of the Liberal Party, even though caring about the environment is virtuous, I would probably back off on the issue and take an approach more similar to Poilievre's.

I don't think Poilievre is a terrible person. I think somewhere along the way, he embraced being the Conservative Party's "attack dog" because he's a good speaker, he navigates questions well, he's quick on his feet. I think he does want what's good for the country---but in trying to play that role, and to take down Trudeau, he's sacrificed too much. He plays the game, the media the game, the attention economy game, the game of soundbites and headlines and YouTube shorts. I think he's chosen to play fast and loose with the facts, and to degrade our standards, all because it gets attention for himself, to give him an edge, to help him win. And in his own heart, if he thinks that he's the right choice for the country, then maybe he's able to justify that to himself. He has to play dirty to get ahead, to do the right thing.

That's the charitable interpretation of him as a person. And if that were the case, then perhaps in the timeline where Poilievre becomes Prime Minister, his behaviour would change. Perhaps it's exaggerated now because he's the Opposition Leader, and that as Prime Minister he would be more measured and unifying, less insulting and bombastic, and more honest. For my American friends, think about how in the primary race to determine their nominee, candidates of the same party will become very critical of and attack one another, but then after the nominee is chosen and we move into the general, they become friendlier with one another, because that phase is over. A person's behaviour can change depending on what role they're in, depending on what goals they have at the time.

If Poilievre does become Prime Minister, that is what I will be hoping for. I'll be hoping for the best. But I don't support him, because I fear that will not be the case. His behaviour so far has told me that he is not somebody who wants to pull Canada in a good direction. And it's worth considering that somebody shouldn't be rewarded for acting this way for years, even if they promise to stop afterwards. Even if you understand the dynamic, a candidate's behaviour in the primary race can make you not want them as nominee.

Even if that did come true, I have disagreements with the Conservative Party about their attitude toward funding social services like healthcare. In provincial politics, the Conservative Party tends to push in the direction of less money for healthcare, less money for infrastructure, and for privatizing things that should be kept in the hands of government. In federal politics, a great example of where we come into conflict is the CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Established in 1936, it is *the* Canadian public broadcaster---every Canadian knows it, we've all seen it. It's a very valuable institution to have, especially now. The state and future of journalism today is grim.

I think the right-wing today---not Poilievre in particular, but the right-wing in general, including Poilievre---is leading an assault on journalism and media that is going to have bad implications for a long time, the more so they succeed. It's a very bad sign that the longest, most serious interview Poilievre has ever done was not with actual journalists who might criticize or push back on things he may say, but with national embarrassment and disgraced alt-media podcaster Jordan Peterson. To appear on the same stage as this man isn't disqualifying, but it's definitely a bad choice, not only because you're helping this clown's career, but in terms of what it tells us about your priorities and your preference for by what means to communicate with your people.

Hang on, I was trying to end on a slightly more positive note. I like his immigration takes, and I am glad that he's an MP, unlike the recently elected Liberal Party leader, Mr. Carney, who's never held an elected position before. That does really bother me. But politics is about finding the better option, not the perfect option. And if you are a Canadian who feels that Mr. Poilievre is the better option, despite his flaws, because you think what other parties are offering is even worse, then I disagree, but I respect your choice, and I would not have moral qualms working for a Poilievre government.

I make these final statements to clarify the gravity or severity of the situation and of my criticism. I have been rather explicit in my opinion that the United States has gone off the rails and that their current president is a criminal and a traitor to the country. He does not care what is good for Americans, he does not care whether or not his actions are legal, he does not care about democracy. It is no exaggeration to say he made a deliberate effort to overthrow American democracy and install himself as president despite knowing he was not rightly elected. This is a man who wants to turn the United States into a dictatorship and rule over it in the style of Putin or Stalin before him. Were I American, I would pay him no respect and offer him no compromise. That is not at all how we should feel as Canadians. That is not where we are as a country.

But I think it's the direction that Poilievre will pull us in, at least a little bit. He's a demagouge, he's a good talker, but he doesn't offer clear solutions, he's not very principled, he's a bad influence. He's wrong for Canada.

Check out my video about Trudeau, where I talk about his ethics scandals, if you want to know my thoughts about that, although you do have to judge a Prime Minister and an Opposition Leader by different standards, because naturally the latter hasn't had the same opportunities to make mistakes, being they aren't the ones governing.
