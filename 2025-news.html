# **News 2025**

It's a new year, so we're doing another news tracker. It's Trump season again, so prepare for a lot of bad news. It's probably going to be even worse this time around than his first term.

There will be a lot of things happening all at once. This is intentional. They want everything to be chaotic, they want it to be just one thing after the next, they want you to feel exhausted because then you'll stop caring as much or pay less attention. It all just becomes a blur.

It also results in nobody remembering anything. That's what happened last time: by the end of his term, people couldn't remember what a disaster it was. It's hard to keep track. That's why it's useful to just keep a simple list of events.
