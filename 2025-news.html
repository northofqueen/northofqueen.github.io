# **2025 news**

It's Trump season again---ring the bells, or whatever. There will be a lot of things happening all at once, which is intentional and strategic. Not strategy by Trump himself, but the people around him, like Bannon, Miller, etc., god knows who else. It's intended to be frustrating, overwhelming, and chaotic. It's supposed to wear you down, make everything just become a blur. That's what happened last time: by the end of it, people couldn't even remember what a disaster it was. It's hard to keep track. That's why it's useful to just keep a list of noteworthy things that happen.
