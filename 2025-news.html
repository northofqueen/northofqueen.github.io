# **News 2025**

It's a new year and it's Trump season again. There will be a lot of things happening all at once. This is intentional. They want everything to be chaotic, they want it to be just one thing after the next, they want you to get exhausted and overwhelmed, because that increases the chances you zone out and just stop caring. It all becomes a blur. That's what happened to a lot of people by the end of Trump's first term; they couldn't even remember what a disaster it was. It's hard to keep track.

Instead of going on about it for hours and hours every day, I'll just be keeping a list of events. No commentary, just a list of things that are happening, with links to good sources. Be aware, but remember to also spend time doing things you actually enjoy.
