**About me:**
I'm Iris. I live in Canada. I'm a transsexual woman. I'm <span class="rendered_digit" id="age"><span class="rendered_digit">30</span></span> years old. I'm an atheist. I'm not a vegan. I've been a very political person since I was a teenager and started reading about economics and philosophy. I remember when politics was more boring and less divisive, before social media came and pumped it into seemingly every aspect of everyone's lives. I'd describe myself as a liberal conservative. The great fight of this age seems to be Western institutions and truth vs. extremism and conspiracy theorismâ€”and since I value institutions and truth, that places me on the 'left', at least in terms of how most people interpret things.

**This repo:**
I'm using this to host things I write or create. I made every aspect of it in notepad. There's no server software; each page just pulls from the same JavaScript files, which add the layout and styling and formats the body text. It's unusual, but it means that if I just clone the directory, it runs the exact same way locally, which pleases me for some reason. I literally added the black fade-in to hide the split second before the styling loads.
